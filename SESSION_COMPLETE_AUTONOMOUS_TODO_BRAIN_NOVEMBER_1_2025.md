## 🎯 WHAT COMMANDER NEEDS TO DO

**3 Decisions (45 minutes total):**

1. **Extract $5K from Coinbase** (30 min)
   - Unlocks: Stripe integration, employee hiring, 8 downstream tasks
   - Priority: CRITICAL

2. **Post Fiverr Job** (15 min)
   - Unlocks: 18 employee tasks, 150 account creation, API setup
   - Priority: CRITICAL

3. **Trust Autonomous System** (instant decision)
   - Unlocks: 27 tasks execute without review
   - Priority: PHILOSOPHICAL BREAKTHROUGH

## 📊 BRAIN ARCHITECTURE

### **Central Concept:**
Constitutional government model where Commander = President, Trinity = Cabinet Ministers.

### **How It Works:**
```
Every Action
    ↓
Extract Follow-up TODOs
    ↓
Calculate Priority (0-100)
    ↓
Assign to Agent (C1/C2/C3/Employee/Commander)
    ↓
Add to Brain Spreadsheet
    ↓
Autonomous Executor Selects Next Task
    ↓
Execute Without Review (if doesn't require Commander)
    ↓
Mark Complete
    ↓
Extract New TODOs from Completion
    ↓
REPEAT INFINITELY
```

### **Result:**
TODOs generate faster than completion (organic growth).
