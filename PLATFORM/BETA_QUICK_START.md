## 🎮 How to Use It (5-Minute Tutorial)

### Step 1: Assign AI Agents to Seats

1. Click on any seat (1-6)
2. Choose an AI from the dropdown:
   - 🟣 Claude
   - 🟢 ChatGPT
   - 🔴 Grok
   - 🔵 DeepSeek
   - 💎 Gemini
   - 🟠 Perplexity

3. Repeat for as many seats as you want (use 2-6 AIs)

**Pro Tip:** You don't have to fill all 6 seats - start with 2-3 AIs!

---

### Step 2: Ask Your Question

1. Make sure "🏠 Post as Dealer" mode is selected (bottom)
2. Type your question in the text box
3. Click "📤 SEND MESSAGE"

**Example Questions:**
- "How should we build real-time collaboration?"
- "What's the best database for this project?"
- "How do we organize 800+ files?"

---

### Step 3: Get Responses from AIs (Manual for Now)

**For each AI you assigned:**

1. Open the AI in a NEW browser tab:
   - Claude: https://claude.ai
   - ChatGPT: https://chat.openai.com
   - Grok: https://x.ai
   - DeepSeek: https://deepseek.com
   - Gemini: https://gemini.google.com
   - Perplexity: https://perplexity.ai

2. **Copy your question** from the workspace

3. **Paste it into the AI** and send

4. **Copy the AI's response**

5. Go back to workspace

6. **Select that AI's seat mode** (e.g., "Seat 1" if Claude is in Seat 1)

7. **Paste the response** in the text box

8. Click "📤 SEND MESSAGE"

9. Repeat for each AI

**Yes, it's manual! That's intentional - we're finding workflow kinks!**

---

### Step 4: Vote on Responses

1. Read all the AI responses
2. Click 👍 on helpful responses
3. Click 👎 on unhelpful ones
4. Best answers rise to the top!

---

### Step 5: Export Your Session

1. Click "📥 Export" button (top right)
2. Copy the JSON or click "💾 Download"
3. Save it somewhere safe
4. You can import it later to continue the conversation

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why is it manual? Isn't that tedious?**
A: YES! That's the point. We want to feel the pain points before automating. Your feedback tells us WHAT to automate first.

**Q: Do I have to use all 6 seats?**
A: Nope! Use 2-3 to start. See what feels right.

**Q: Can multiple people use it at once?**
A: Not yet (Phase 4). For now, each person runs their own session and exports to share.

**Q: What if I lose my work?**
A: It saves to LocalStorage automatically. But export regularly to be safe!

**Q: Can I use it on mobile?**
A: Yes! It's responsive. Report how well it works.

**Q: The poker table metaphor is confusing - why not just "workspace"?**
A: Perfect feedback! That's exactly what we want to know. Tell us!
