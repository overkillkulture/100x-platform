### 3. KORPAK Autonomous Engine
**Status:** ⚠️ DEPENDENCY REQUIRED

**File:** `/home/user/100x-platform/BACKEND/korpak_autonomous_engine.py`
**Expected Port:** 5006
**Process ID:** 379d83 (exited)

**Error Encountered:**
```
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'psycopg2'
```

**Analysis:**
- KORPAK requires PostgreSQL database connection library
- Script exits immediately when dependency is missing
- This is expected in development environments without full setup

**Resolution Required:**
```bash
pip install psycopg2-binary
```

**KORPAK Capabilities (documented, untested):**
- Mission generation across 7 business domains
- Fibonacci expansion (1 → 10 → 100 missions)
- Success tracking and metrics
- Self-improvement through pattern recognition

**Endpoints (untested due to dependency):**
- `/api/korpak/generate/revenue`
- `/api/korpak/generate/growth`
- `/api/korpak/create`
- `/api/korpak/<id>/execute`
- `/api/korpak/<id>/expand`
- `/api/korpak/dashboard`

**Recommendation:** Install psycopg2-binary for full KORPAK functionality

**Validation:** ⚠️ System exists but requires dependency installation

### 5. Protocol 13D System Audit
**Status:** 🔄 DEFERRED (Browser Required)

**File:** `/home/user/100x-platform/AUDIT_PROTOCOL_13D.html`

- Visual interface interaction
- Button clicking ("RUN FULL AUDIT")
- Real-time progress monitoring

**What Protocol 13D Tests:**
- 15 system nodes across the platform
- Core pages (Poker Table, Seven Domains Hub, 8 Domain Pages)
- Feature systems (Araya Chat, Bug Monitor, Trinity Command)
- Builder Workspace connectivity
- All links and buttons across the platform

**Recommendation for Future Tests:**
- Run in browser environment
- Execute "RUN FULL AUDIT" button
- Monitor 15 node tests
- Export JSON report
- Document visual blueprint results

**Validation:** 🔄 System exists, requires browser for execution
