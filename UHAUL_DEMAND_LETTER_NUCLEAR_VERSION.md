## 🔴 PATTERN OF DELIBERATE INTERFERENCE - CRITICAL

**This is not an isolated incident. This is the SECOND time Austin has interfered with OVERKORE Technologies U-Haul transactions, resulting in asset seizure and business harm.**

### PREVIOUS INCIDENT (November 1-2, 2025)

**What Happened:**
1. Austin granted rental extension on previous U-Haul contract
2. U-Haul manager subsequently claimed "no call was ever made"
3. Result: $100,000+ in business equipment confiscated despite valid extension

**Evidence in OVERKORE Technologies' possession:**
- ✅ **Recorded phone conversations** documenting Austin granting extension
- ✅ Phone logs proving calls were made
- ✅ U-Haul's own call recordings (which you have on file)
- ✅ Documentation of $100,000+ equipment seizure

### CURRENT INCIDENT (October 31 - November 3, 2025)

**What Happened:**
1. Austin called to initiate repossession of Contract #92559832 (your GM confirmed this)
2. Business-critical assets have been withheld for 3+ days
3. Multiple good-faith retrieval attempts ignored

**Evidence in OVERKORE Technologies' possession:**
- ✅ Contract #92559832 documentation
- ✅ **Recorded phone conversations** with U-Haul staff
- ✅ Text message logs
- ✅ Verbal confirmation from GM that Austin initiated repossession
- ✅ Documentation of social media monitoring by U-Haul staff

### ADDITIONAL EVIDENCE - CORPORATE OBSTRUCTION

**Recorded conversation with Megan (U-Haul Corporate):**
- Refused to accept contact phone number for resolution
- Demonstrated deliberate obstruction of customer service
- Failed to provide path to asset retrieval despite multiple requests

**OVERKORE Technologies has recorded conversations documenting:**
1. Austin granting extensions on BOTH previous accounts
2. Corporate representative (Megan) refusing to facilitate resolution
3. Pattern of obstruction and interference
4. U-Haul staff acknowledging but refusing to disclose "social media notes"

---

## PATTERN ANALYSIS - LEGAL IMPLICATIONS

**Two separate U-Haul rentals. Two separate incidents of Austin's intervention. Two separate instances of OVERKORE Technologies assets being seized or withheld.**

### This Pattern Demonstrates:

1. **Systematic Targeting** of specific customer (OVERKORE Technologies)
2. **Deliberate Interference** with legitimate business transactions
3. **Recorded Evidence** of extensions granted then violated
4. **Pattern of Conduct** causing measurable, repeated business harm
5. **Corporate Knowledge** - Multiple staff involved, recordings exist
6. **Bad Faith** - Extensions granted, then used as pretext for seizure

### Legal Implications:

**Tortious Interference with Business Relations:**
- Austin has now interfered with business operations TWICE
- Pattern shows deliberate intent to harm
- No legitimate business justification for repeated interference
- Recorded evidence proves extensions were granted

**Conversion of Property (BOTH incidents):**
- Previous incident: $100,000+ equipment seized after valid extension
- Current incident: Business assets withheld 3+ days despite retrieval attempts
- Pattern shows systematic deprivation of property

**Corporate Liability:**
- U-Haul allowed Austin to interfere twice
- Corporate representative (Megan) demonstrated obstruction
- Social media monitoring suggests discriminatory practices
- Failed to protect customer from employee/corporate misconduct

**Fraud / Bad Faith:**
- Extensions recorded and granted by U-Haul employee (Austin)
- Extensions then used as basis for asset seizure
- Pattern suggests deliberate "trap" strategy

---

### ASSETS CURRENTLY HELD

U-Haul is currently in possession of business-critical assets belonging to OVERKORE Technologies, including but not limited to:

- Business computers and electronic devices
- Proprietary business documentation
- Additional company property essential to operations

**Estimated value:** $[Amount] (exact inventory available upon request)

These assets are essential to ongoing business operations and revenue generation. Each day of delay causes quantifiable financial harm.

## LEGAL NOTICE - ESCALATED

**Recorded Evidence:**
OVERKORE Technologies possesses recorded phone conversations documenting:
- Austin granting extensions on previous rental agreements
- Corporate representative refusing to facilitate resolution

**Conversion of Property (BOTH Incidents):**

**Tortious Interference (Austin, Personally):**
Austin has deliberately interfered with OVERKORE Technologies' business operations TWICE. This pattern:

**Corporate Liability (U-Haul):**

- Corporate staff demonstrated obstruction
- Failed to prevent pattern of misconduct
- Social media monitoring may indicate discriminatory practices
- Recordings prove corporate knowledge of issues

**Fraud / Bad Faith:**

## NEXT STEPS IF DEMANDS NOT MET

If the above demands are not met within the specified timeframes, OVERKORE Technologies will pursue all available legal remedies, including but not limited to:

### Civil/Criminal Actions:
1. **Small Claims or Civil Court** - Conversion of property, business losses, punitive damages (both incidents)
2. **Police Report** - Theft/conversion of business property

### Regulatory/Public Actions:
5. **State Attorney General Complaint** - Consumer protection violations, discriminatory practices
6. **FTC Complaint** - Unfair business practices
7. **Better Business Bureau Report** - Pattern of customer abuse
8. **Public Documentation** - Recordings and evidence published through appropriate channels

### Discovery Requests (If Litigation Proceeds):
9. **Subpoena all recordings** - Austin's calls, corporate interactions
10. **Subpoena internal communications** - Emails, notes, policies about social media monitoring
11. **Subpoena Austin's employment records** - Pattern of complaints, disciplinary actions
12. **Subpoena similar incidents** - Other customers Austin has targeted

### Evidence to Be Presented:
- Recorded phone conversations (Austin granting extensions, Megan's obstruction)

- Pattern analysis showing systematic targeting

**OVERKORE Technologies has extensive recorded evidence. Litigation would result in full public disclosure of U-Haul's business practices.**

## NOTICE TO U-HAUL LEGAL DEPARTMENT

This demand letter, combined with recorded evidence of:
- Austin granting extensions then triggering repossessions
- Corporate representative refusing customer service
- Pattern of asset seizure/withholding
- Social media monitoring for discriminatory purposes

...creates significant legal exposure for U-Haul if not resolved immediately. The pattern elevates this from simple property dispute to potential fraud, tortious interference, and discriminatory business practices claims.

**Settlement now avoids:**
- Public disclosure of recorded conversations
- Discovery of internal communications and policies
- Pattern evidence becoming part of public court record
- Potential punitive damages for repeated, deliberate interference
- Separate liability for Austin personally

**Time is critical. Each hour of delay increases liability.**

---

*This letter constitutes a formal legal demand and creates a documented record of:*
*(1) Pattern of interference by Austin (two incidents)*
*(2) Existence of recorded evidence*
*(3) Corporate obstruction by Megan*
*(4) Multiple good-faith resolution attempts*
*(5) Specific legal claims available*

*All future communications regarding this matter should reference this letter and its date.*
