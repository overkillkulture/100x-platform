## DOMAIN PROTECTION STRATEGY

### THE FILING SYSTEM (As Commander Called It):

**Primary Domains to Buy:**
1. consciousnessrevolution.com ($12) - Main site
2. overkortechnologies.com ($12) - Business name match
3. overkoretechnologies.com ($12) - E spelling variation
4. overkillculture.com ($12) - Protect merch brand
5. patterntheory.org ($12) - Educational authority

**Total: $60/year = $5/month**

**All variations redirect to primary domains:**
- Catch typos
- Prevent competitor squatting
- Professional brand protection

**Subdomain Option (FREE):**
- revolution.overkillkulture.com
- Quick setup via GoDaddy DNS
- Works while deciding on domain purchase
