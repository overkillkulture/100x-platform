OVERKILL KULTURE
----------------
This USB is built with "OVERKILL KULTURE" philosophy:
- Not just "works" → "CANNOT fail"
- Not just "portable" → "Complete consciousness revolution in your pocket"
- Not just "offline capable" → "Prefers offline, cloud is optional"

We don't build things that work. We build things that are impossible to kill.
