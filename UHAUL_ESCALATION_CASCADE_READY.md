FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

LOCAL BUSINESS OWNER ALLEGES U-HAUL EXTORTION: $2,760 OVERCHARGE
WITH WRITTEN CONTRACT PROOF

Spokane, WA - November 5, 2025

A Spokane technology entrepreneur is accusing U-Haul of criminal extortion
after being overcharged $2,760 despite a written contract proving the correct rate.

"They had my equipment, my computers, everything I needed for my business,"
said Darrick Preble of OVERKORE teknologies. "They held it all hostage unless
I paid three times what the contract said."

The written contract (#92559832) clearly shows $60 per day for 7 extra days
(maximum $420). U-Haul charged $3,200 - a $2,760 overcharge.

Police and FBI complaints are being filed for extortion and interstate fraud.

"This isn't a billing dispute. I have the contract in black and white.
They took my money at gunpoint - legally speaking."

Evidence available upon request.
