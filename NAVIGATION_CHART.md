## 💡 THE SIMPLE RULE

**Every page needs:**
1. ✅ Clear title (where am I?)
2. ✅ Obvious action (what can I do?)
3. ✅ Back button (how do I leave?)
4. ✅ Visual feedback (did it work?)

**Just like GTA:**
- Mission page shows mission name ✅
- Shows "Start Mission" button ✅
- Shows "Back to Map" option ✅
- Shows progress bar when mission starts ✅
