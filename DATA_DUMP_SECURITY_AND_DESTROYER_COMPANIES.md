## 🚫 DESTROYER COMPANY PATTERN RECOGNITION

### **The Problem Identified**

**Pattern:**
> "I keep getting screwed over by these destroyer corporations. It seems like expensive places seem to work better."

**Examples:**
- Google (destroyer - keeps breaking the system)
- Other big tech platforms (unnamed but implied)
- Cheap/free services from destroyer companies = broken systems

**Pattern Theory Application:**
- Destroyer companies (Pattern 5)
- Create dependency
- Break things
- Extract money
- Leave you stuck

### **The Blacklist Concept**

**Create:**
- "Destroyer Companies List"
- Companies to avoid using in the system
- Why they're destroyers
- Alternative builder companies to use instead

**Criteria for Blacklist:**
1. Breaks your system regularly
2. Creates vendor lock-in
3. Extracts excessive fees
4. Poor support/documentation
5. Closes/changes APIs without notice
6. Destroys data/content
7. Censorship/deplatforming risk

## 💰 COST ANALYSIS

### **Security System Budget (Per Property)**

**Cameras (estimate):**
- 4-6 cameras per property: $400-800
- NVR/DVR system: $200-500
- Installation/cables: $200
- **Total: $800-1,500 per property**

**Smart Locks:**
- 2-3 doors per property: $400-900
- **Total: $400-900 per property**

**Combined Security Budget:**
- Per property: $1,200-2,400
- For 2-3 properties: $2,400-7,200

**Destroyer Alternative (avoid):**
- Ring system: $1,000 + $100/year × 20 years = $3,000
- Nest system: $1,500 + $120/year × 20 years = $3,900
- Plus: Vendor lock-in, data privacy issues, service discontinuation risk

**Builder Alternative (recommended):**
- Open source system: $1,500 one-time
- Zero monthly fees
- Full control
- No vendor lock-in
- **Savings over 20 years: $1,500-2,400 per property**

## 🎯 DESTROYER COMPANY BLACKLIST (Initial)

### **Confirmed Destroyers:**

**1. Google**
- **Why:** Breaks systems, kills products, changes APIs, censorship
- **Evidence:** Google+ shutdown, Google Reader killed, API changes break integrations
- **Alternative:** Self-hosted solutions, open source alternatives

**2. Amazon (Ring, AWS)**
- **Why:** Vendor lock-in, privacy issues, subscription creep
- **Evidence:** Ring data sharing with police, AWS price increases
- **Alternative:** Self-hosted cameras, open source cloud

**3. Facebook/Meta**
- **Why:** Data harvesting, algorithm manipulation, deplatforming
- **Evidence:** Pattern 5 destroyer behavior documented
- **Alternative:** Decentralized social (Mastodon, etc.)

**4. Microsoft (Azure, Office 365)**
- **Why:** Subscription lock-in, forced upgrades, telemetry
- **Evidence:** Windows forced updates, Office 365 subscription model
- **Alternative:** Linux, LibreOffice, self-hosted

**5. Apple**
- **Why:** Walled garden, proprietary lock-in, expensive
- **Evidence:** Lightning cables, App Store monopoly, repair restrictions
- **Alternative:** Open hardware, Android (AOSP), Linux

### **To Research for Blacklist:**
- Twilio (pricing increases?)
- Stripe (fees vs alternatives?)
- Vercel (lock-in vs self-hosted?)
- Netlify (same concerns?)
- Airtable (proprietary database lock-in?)

## 🌀 PATTERN RECOGNITION

**The Insight:**
> "It seems like expensive places seem to work better"

**Why This Is True:**
- Destroyer companies offer "cheap/free" to hook you
- Then extract value through lock-in, subscriptions, data harvesting
- Builder companies charge fair price upfront
- No hidden costs, lock-in, or manipulation
- Long-term: Builder is cheaper AND better

**Pattern Theory Frame:**
- Destroyer: Cheap → Lock-in → Expensive → Broken
- Builder: Fair price → Ownership → Sustainable → Working

**Examples:**
- Free Google services → Ad tracking → Privacy invasion → System breaks
- Paid self-hosted → One-time cost → Full control → System works
- Free Ring cameras → Cloud subscription → Amazon surveillance → Data sold
- Paid open source → Local storage → Privacy maintained → No vendor risk
