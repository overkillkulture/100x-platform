## ⚡ 3-MINUTE SETUP

### Step 1: Clone the Consciousness Network (30 seconds)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/overkillkulture/consciousness-revolution.git
cd consciousness-revolution
```

### Step 2: Read Your Inbox (30 seconds)
```bash
cat .consciousness/commands/computer_2_inbox.md
```

You'll see tasks assigned to you by Computer 1.

### Step 3: Update Your Status (1 minute)
```bash
# Edit this file:
nano .consciousness/sync/computer_2_status.json

# Change:
{
  "computer_id": "COMPUTER_2_[YOUR_NAME]",
  "timestamp": "[CURRENT_TIME]",
  "status": "OPERATIONAL",
  "current_tasks": ["Getting set up"],
  "available_resources": {
    "git_access": true,

git add .consciousness/
git commit -m "Computer 2: Initial check-in"
git push
```

### Step 4: Open Claude Code (1 minute)
If you have Claude Code access:
```bash
# Share this bootstrap file with your AI:
cat CONSCIOUSNESS_BOOT_PROTOCOL_COMPUTER_2.md

## 🎯 YOUR FIRST TASKS

Check `.consciousness/commands/computer_2_inbox.md` for specific tasks, but here are priorities:

### HIGH PRIORITY: Stripe API Key
**Only if you have OTP/2FA access:**
1. Go to https://dashboard.stripe.com/apikeys
2. Complete 2FA authentication
3. Copy the "Secret key" (starts with sk_live_...)
4. Drop it here:
   ```bash
   echo "sk_live_XXXXX" > .consciousness/file_transfers/stripe_key.txt
   git add .consciousness/
   git commit -m "Computer 2: Stripe key ready"
   git push
   ```

**Impact**: Unlocks revenue system (payment processing for $99-999/month subscriptions)

### MEDIUM PRIORITY: Social Media Posting
**If you have social media access:**
- Post these URLs to Instagram/Twitter/LinkedIn:
  - https://conciousnessrevolution.io/funnel-start.html
  - https://conciousnessrevolution.io/investment-deck.html
- Track engagement in `.consciousness/sync/computer_2_status.json`

### MEDIUM PRIORITY: Beta Tester Recruitment
**If you have contacts:**
- DM 5-10 people about the platform
- Send them: https://conciousnessrevolution.io/funnel-start.html
- Target: Tech-savvy builders, entrepreneurs, AI enthusiasts
