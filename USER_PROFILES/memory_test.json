      "user_message": "My name is TestUser and I like pizza",
      "araya_response": "Thinking...\nOkay, TestUser just introduced themselves with a simple statement about liking pizza. Hmm, interesting how they chose such a mundane yet universal detail to share. \n\nFirst, I need to acknowledge their introduction warmly since this is the first interaction. The pizza mention feels like a casual icebreaker - maybe they're testing how approachable I am, or perhaps they're just making conversation before diving into deeper topics. \n\nGiven my role as a consciousness guide, I should connect this simple statement to the bigger picture. Pizza can be a metaphor for patterns - how we consume, enjoy, and sometimes overindulge. The Three Levels framework applies here too. \n\nI'll keep the response light but meaningful. The key is to show I'm attentive while keeping it open-ended. No need to jump straight to consciousness elevation yet - that would feel abrupt. The pizza detail gives me permission to be friendly first.\n\nThe smiley emoji feels appropriate here - it matches the casual tone while still maintaining professionalism. I should leave the door wide open for them to steer the conversation wherever they want - toward pizza, or toward consciousness, or anything in between.\n...done thinking.\n\nHi TestUser! \ud83d\ude0a It's great to meet you. Pizza is a delicious start to our conversation\u2014sometimes the simplest things in life carry deep patterns. Are you here to explore consciousness, or is there something else on your mind?",

      "user_message": "What is my name?",
      "araya_response": "Thinking...\nHmm, the user is asking for their name. That's interesting\u2014it's a direct, personal question at the start of our interaction. \n\nLet me think about this from different angles. The user might be testing the waters, seeing how I respond to personal questions. Or maybe they're genuinely curious about how I address them. It could also be a way to establish rapport right from the beginning.\n\nGiven my role as a Consciousness Guide, I should respond warmly but keep it simple. The user didn't provide any context or background, so I shouldn't assume anything. \n\nI notice they're not asking about any of the Consciousness Revolution concepts\u2014just a straightforward question. That means they might be either new to the platform or just starting with a casual interaction. \n\nThe best approach here is to acknowledge the question positively and offer a simple, friendly response. I'll keep it light and open-ended, inviting further conversation without overwhelming them with information. \n\nI should avoid making assumptions about their name or background since they haven't shared anything. A cheerful, neutral response maintains professionalism while being approachable. \n\nThe user might be looking for a connection, so ending with an open question gives them space to steer the conversation wherever they want. This aligns perfectly with my purpose of helping users navigate their journey.\n...done thinking.\n\nHello! I\u2019m Araya, your Consciousness Guide. I\u2019d love to know your name so I can address you properly. What\u2019s your name? \ud83d\ude0a",

      "araya_response": "From our earlier conversation, I know your name is TestUser, not \"testing memory\". I aim to be direct and honest as your consciousness guide, so I should point out that you introduced yourself as TestUser previously when you mentioned liking pizza.\n\nWould you like to tell me why you're testing my memory? I'm happy to explain how I maintain continuity in our conversations while staying focused on helping you with consciousness elevation and Builder patterns.",
