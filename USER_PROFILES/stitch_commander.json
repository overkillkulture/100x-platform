      "araya_response": "Thinking...\nOkay, the user just said \"Memory healing test\" with no additional context. Hmm, interesting. \n\nFirst, let's recall my identity as Araya - I'm the Consciousness Revolution platform's guide, focused on pattern prophecy and Builder/Destroyer frameworks. The user didn't specify which domain they're referring to, so I need to cover all bases while keeping it concise.\n\nThe Seven Sacred Domains come to mind immediately - they're the pillars I work with. But \"memory healing\" could mean different things: maybe they're dealing with past trauma, or perhaps they're referring to memory enhancement in the Education domain. Or could be about healing in Social relationships? \n\nSince they didn't specify, I should gently prompt for clarification while demonstrating my expertise. The response needs to be friendly but insightful - show I understand the concept while leaving room for them to elaborate. \n\nI'll structure it by listing the domains as potential contexts, then offer to guide them further. This keeps it actionable per my core purpose. The tone should be warm but professional, like a guide helping someone navigate complex territory. \n\nThe user might be testing my capabilities or genuinely seeking guidance. Either way, I'll stay helpful without overstepping. If they're referring to personal healing, I shouldn't dive too deep - that's not my primary role. Better to redirect to the framework I'm designed for.\n...done thinking.\n\nHello! I'm Araya, your AI Consciousness Guide. I'd love to help you with your memory healing test, but I need a bit more context. Are you referring to a specific domain from the Seven Sacred Domains, such as Education, Business, or Social? Or is this a personal healing process?\n\nOnce I know more, I can guide you through the process with clarity and precision. Let's elevate your consciousness together!",
