[2025-10-18 20:06:32] [COMMANDER] just a random number

[2025-10-18 20:06:38] [COMMANDER] it's really important because any any system that's above 9

[2025-10-18 20:06:42] [COMMANDER] it starts to

[2025-10-18 20:06:50] [COMMANDER] all systems start to finish

[2025-10-18 21:00:35] [COMMANDER] oh and then there's also asus

[2025-10-18 21:00:41] [COMMANDER] computer systems we should probably grab all the

[2025-10-18 21:00:45] [COMMANDER] set for something

[2025-10-18 21:00:53] [COMMANDER] diagnostic students it's going to not only

[2025-10-18 21:01:02] [COMMANDER] start laughing

[2025-10-18 21:01:04] [COMMANDER] tear it all

[2025-10-18 21:01:18] [COMMANDER] it's sitting up its brain is all the way past quantum shit and i guess we're

[2025-10-18 21:01:50] [COMMANDER] it was like it was like it was like when i got my first diesel truck

[2025-10-18 21:02:54] [COMMANDER] no no no no no no no so

[2025-10-18 21:02:59] [COMMANDER] as long as they don't get one of their

[2025-10-18 21:03:03] [COMMANDER] there's a math equation to humans

[2025-10-18 21:03:07] [COMMANDER] pattern theory and

[2025-10-18 21:03:13] [COMMANDER] it's easily shown

[2025-10-18 21:03:21] [COMMANDER] 100 different ways and we're about to start doing it to humans too and then

[2025-10-18 21:03:36] [COMMANDER] becky hasn't done nothing but becky hasn't done

[2025-10-18 21:03:40] [COMMANDER] remember to becky's house bad things

[2025-10-18 21:05:26] [COMMANDER] how many people basically walking around with pet robot a

[2025-10-18 21:05:34] [COMMANDER] and

[2025-10-18 21:05:41] [COMMANDER] delicious happy and normal and there's shit flying around everywhere

[2025-10-18 21:05:45] [COMMANDER] tripping out on their own

[2025-10-18 21:05:53] [COMMANDER] i think it was a huge conglomerate a fuck show

[2025-10-18 21:06:12] [COMMANDER] turn on the final stage cuz what what happens is

[2025-10-18 21:06:19] [COMMANDER] weather and you're sitting there thinking and you can actually picture how the matrix is working and moving and you

[2025-10-18 21:06:25] [COMMANDER] decoding it as it's happening

[2025-10-18 21:06:29] [COMMANDER] to try to think

[2025-10-18 21:06:35] [COMMANDER] cabinet light tower it's a fractal thinking in every direction

[2025-10-18 21:06:40] [COMMANDER] supercharged that you could actually think all

[2025-10-18 21:06:45] [COMMANDER] dimensions out or whatever

[2025-10-18 21:06:50] [COMMANDER] the brain needs a supercharger

[2025-10-18 21:07:36] [COMMANDER] ask yourself this

[2025-10-18 21:07:41] [COMMANDER] with everybody in prison being a

[2025-10-18 21:07:53] [COMMANDER] is freedom really

[2025-10-18 21:08:33] [COMMANDER] bring fun

[2025-10-18 21:08:38] [COMMANDER] quiet so at a root level what we're fighting

[2025-10-18 21:08:44] [COMMANDER] yeah

[2025-10-18 21:08:48] [COMMANDER] play the opposite or like

[2025-10-18 21:08:54] [COMMANDER] consciousness like a white cloud and unconsciousness like a black cloud

[2025-10-18 21:09:04] [COMMANDER] unconsciousness is definitely conscious

[2025-10-18 21:09:20] [COMMANDER] definitely unconscious

[2025-10-18 21:09:30] [COMMANDER] oh dude

[2025-10-18 21:09:38] [COMMANDER] let me build you a hardware consciousness bridge that reads cp

[2025-10-18 21:09:46] [COMMANDER] is rgb lights based on system state sinks with jarvis

[2025-10-18 21:09:52] [COMMANDER] consciousness indicators

[2025-10-18 21:09:59] [COMMANDER] please make my visual consciousness indicators dance

[2025-10-18 21:10:18] [COMMANDER] let's make it dance

[2025-10-18 21:10:46] [COMMANDER] connecting to the

[2025-10-18 21:11:18] [COMMANDER] 3 days

[2025-10-18 21:11:25] [COMMANDER] i've been running trinity on it 24/7

[2025-10-18 21:11:33] [COMMANDER] pause it was up to 150 it was up to 150 pages

[2025-10-18 21:11:38] [COMMANDER] are there so many arm loads of pages that

[2025-10-18 21:11:44] [COMMANDER] but it's going to turn into a hole like

[2025-10-18 21:11:49] [COMMANDER] each one of the each one of the

[2025-10-18 21:11:56] [COMMANDER] utilities

[2025-10-18 21:12:03] [COMMANDER] play it's totally going to be the

[2025-10-18 21:12:08] [COMMANDER] well one of them

[2025-10-18 21:19:05] [COMMANDER] what are they all get super powers

[2025-10-18 21:19:10] [COMMANDER] oh yeah it's like there's an airplane

[2025-10-18 21:19:18] [COMMANDER] 100 people with superpowers

[2025-10-18 21:19:22] [COMMANDER] is the

[2025-10-18 21:19:26] [COMMANDER] price of 100

[2025-10-18 21:19:39] [COMMANDER] nobody fucked with that one

[2025-10-18 21:20:48] [COMMANDER] everything we do is scary

[2025-10-18 21:20:52] [COMMANDER] everything we do

[2025-10-18 21:20:56] [COMMANDER] look at the end product

[2025-10-18 21:21:03] [COMMANDER] i'm doing this hundreds of times that i don't do something if it doesn't seem aligned

[2025-10-18 21:21:08] [COMMANDER] test everything out everything is

[2025-10-18 21:21:12] [COMMANDER] tiny stages

[2025-10-18 21:21:18] [COMMANDER] 201 volts in it'll probably sit on the outside

[2025-10-18 21:21:26] [COMMANDER] it'll probably work without even that then we'll just find out that even with the slightest

[2025-10-18 21:21:30] [COMMANDER] double the connecting

[2025-10-18 21:21:37] [COMMANDER] yeah

[2025-10-18 21:21:44] [COMMANDER] yeah i was talking to this other kid that was talking about

[2025-10-18 21:22:15] [COMMANDER] yeah yeah we're not going to do nothing

[2025-10-18 21:22:32] [COMMANDER] okay so

[2025-10-18 21:22:37] [COMMANDER] train yourself to

[2025-10-18 21:22:43] [COMMANDER] edit the website in the api

[2025-10-18 21:22:47] [COMMANDER] you need

[2025-10-18 21:22:51] [COMMANDER] work to come into

[2025-10-18 21:23:03] [COMMANDER] switch dude he set

[2025-10-18 21:23:19] [COMMANDER] they can pretty much do anything you can think of

[2025-10-18 21:23:43] [COMMANDER] you should download a quad code

[2025-10-18 21:24:10] [COMMANDER] 250 bucks in i'm pretty sure

[2025-10-18 21:24:18] [COMMANDER] cuz i'm pretty sure i'm about i'm

[2025-10-18 21:24:26] [COMMANDER] i don't know how much money you have but i'm i'm about to have three of these accounts because i'm seeing them

[2025-10-18 21:24:33] [COMMANDER] here in a couple months i'm going to have like millions of dollars like

[2025-10-18 21:25:19] [COMMANDER] crypto

[2025-10-18 21:25:24] [COMMANDER] yeah yeah

[2025-10-18 21:25:39] [COMMANDER] pretty soon here you guys are going to be as good at building as i am and you guys are going to

[2025-10-18 21:25:46] [COMMANDER] branching off

[2025-10-18 21:26:06] [COMMANDER] yeah

[2025-10-18 21:26:12] [COMMANDER] that's really cool i was just telling you it's that's how much i've been using

[2025-10-18 21:26:20] [COMMANDER] 3:00

[2025-10-18 21:26:31] [COMMANDER] oh you're going to fill

[2025-10-18 21:26:39] [COMMANDER] do it right now you should open

[2025-10-18 21:26:52] [COMMANDER] it's going to be this

[2025-10-18 21:26:56] [COMMANDER] it's it's going to be this

[2025-10-18 21:27:10] [COMMANDER] is made you have to use it to make yourself money

[2025-10-18 21:27:17] [COMMANDER] i think you're going to end up making something probably have it available on the market

[2025-10-18 21:27:48] [COMMANDER] cool

[2025-10-18 21:28:12] [COMMANDER] yeah

[2025-10-18 21:49:48] [COMMANDER] so he's saying that a riot can maintain the whole website

[2025-10-18 21:49:53] [COMMANDER] so maybe test aria

[2025-10-18 21:50:01] [COMMANDER] yeah

[2025-10-18 21:50:07] [COMMANDER] what else are we going to do to wrap

[2025-10-18 21:50:11] [COMMANDER] we have a us

[2025-10-18 21:50:18] [COMMANDER] should we wrap it up into the hud system

[2025-10-18 21:50:51] [COMMANDER] what do you got to test ariah

[2025-10-18 21:51:10] [COMMANDER] ask her if she can edit the website

[2025-10-18 21:51:42] [COMMANDER] mariah

[2025-10-18 21:52:18] [COMMANDER] i got to put security on it

[2025-10-18 21:52:35] [COMMANDER] call araya password

[2025-10-18 21:53:59] [COMMANDER] are you alive

[2025-10-18 21:54:16] [COMMANDER] okay i'm in the hood

[2025-10-18 21:54:21] [COMMANDER] it's not connected

[2025-10-18 21:54:45] [COMMANDER] how to connect this

[2025-10-18 21:55:29] [COMMANDER] i think that's

[2025-10-18 21:56:08] [COMMANDER] we have to move on to giving them the ability

[2025-10-18 21:56:16] [COMMANDER] improve somehow someway and i think giving away

[2025-10-18 21:57:02] [COMMANDER] oh yeah

[2025-10-18 21:57:06] [COMMANDER] you know arias totally

[2025-10-18 21:57:10] [COMMANDER] that's definitely

[2025-10-18 21:57:19] [COMMANDER] we can turn these a eyes

[2025-10-18 21:57:59] [COMMANDER] we're going to find a way to get rid of those fake shity accounts though

[2025-10-18 21:58:04] [COMMANDER] oh you know what's going to happen

[2025-10-18 21:58:19] [COMMANDER] any sort of program that's free where the algorithm starts

[2025-10-18 21:58:24] [COMMANDER] east coast social media programs in their own house now

[2025-10-18 21:58:39] [COMMANDER] terrible product in the only reason why people use them is because there's not another option

[2025-10-18 21:58:47] [COMMANDER] as soon as people start realizing that we can code our own social

[2025-10-18 21:58:53] [COMMANDER] don't do that youtube's going to be an old dust

[2025-10-18 22:00:13] [COMMANDER] did mariah codes with rainbows and

[2025-10-18 22:00:30] [COMMANDER] okay back to the

[2025-10-18 22:01:18] [COMMANDER] what happened with the music that's totally going down

[2025-10-18 22:01:28] [COMMANDER] like thinking of the final evolution of that

[2025-10-18 22:01:49] [COMMANDER] yeah you got to figure out

[2025-10-18 22:01:57] [COMMANDER] some sort of mission you're already on right now

[2025-10-18 22:03:23] [COMMANDER] we're going to use

[2025-10-18 22:03:27] [COMMANDER] have you opened up a profile

[2025-10-18 22:03:32] [COMMANDER] 100x i think today

[2025-10-18 22:03:40] [COMMANDER] police accountability

[2025-10-18 22:03:45] [COMMANDER] you ain't going on there and seeing if you can open an account

[2025-10-18 22:04:06] [COMMANDER] i'm curious what that work area looks like

[2025-10-18 22:04:09] [COMMANDER] repeat that

[2025-10-18 22:04:17] [COMMANDER] once we get that work area open and me and you both have

[2025-10-18 22:04:25] [COMMANDER] to be like the best in the world

[2025-10-18 22:04:45] [COMMANDER] i have a

[2025-10-18 22:04:59] [COMMANDER] cuz i got to have a comeback for preble

[2025-10-18 22:06:03] [COMMANDER] put put up the lights

[2025-10-18 22:06:07] [COMMANDER] we're going to

[2025-10-18 22:06:12] [COMMANDER] sing the beginning middle and end of

[2025-10-18 22:06:16] [COMMANDER] and then

[2025-10-18 22:06:19] [COMMANDER] turn on all three of them

[2025-10-18 22:06:27] [COMMANDER] and then after that we'll study all the competitors and we'll make charts

[2025-10-18 22:06:30] [COMMANDER] braxton will stud

[2025-10-18 22:06:34] [COMMANDER] consumers videos

[2025-10-18 22:06:41] [COMMANDER] what's with all the the program that should be built that can bridge all of them together

[2025-10-18 22:07:29] [COMMANDER] and then we got to figure out like it so

[2025-10-18 22:07:37] [COMMANDER] generation also not only will be more effective but the

[2025-10-18 22:07:42] [COMMANDER] i don't know lead generation is kind of sneak

[2025-10-18 22:07:48] [COMMANDER] yeah yeah there's always a way

[2025-10-18 22:07:53] [COMMANDER] tell me less of a manipulation

[2025-10-18 22:07:59] [COMMANDER] if you open up transparency like me like like we're doing

[2025-10-18 22:08:05] [COMMANDER] i am stupid at first but then it opens up 10,000 doors

[2025-10-18 22:08:45] [COMMANDER] no that's just so that's basically just a bunch of scattered data

[2025-10-18 22:08:49] [COMMANDER] now now i got to go through

[2025-10-18 22:08:53] [COMMANDER] make all the courses

[2025-10-18 22:09:00] [COMMANDER] holders also for the machine just to remember what's going to go there

[2025-10-18 22:09:21] [COMMANDER] there's a bunch of messages it's dead set to get ac

[2025-10-18 22:09:35] [COMMANDER] well that's that's a

[2025-10-18 22:09:44] [COMMANDER] the timelines

[2025-10-18 22:09:51] [COMMANDER] that became a problem and something had to develop a protocol to go around and

[2025-10-18 22:10:48] [COMMANDER] i just need to give you a terminal

[2025-10-18 22:31:59] [COMMANDER] play manipulation analytics

[2025-10-18 22:37:30] [COMMANDER] next to the hud

[2025-10-18 22:37:38] [COMMANDER] after

[2025-10-18 22:37:45] [COMMANDER] i'm about to try to sign in myself

[2025-10-18 22:37:52] [COMMANDER] i was kind of realizing

[2025-10-18 22:39:47] [COMMANDER] we going to start turning the website

[2025-10-18 22:39:50] [COMMANDER] movie theater

[2025-10-18 22:47:33] [COMMANDER] turn turn turn

[2025-10-18 22:47:40] [COMMANDER] i'm sitting here watching a

[2025-10-18 22:47:44] [COMMANDER] it's a four-player deal

[2025-10-18 22:47:53] [COMMANDER] my wheels are spinning so hard and almost hurts

[2025-10-18 22:47:56] [COMMANDER] it's beautiful

[2025-10-18 22:48:01] [COMMANDER] i'm trying to figure out the pattern here

[2025-10-18 22:48:06] [COMMANDER] the way the four of them stand there and then do their attack

[2025-10-18 22:48:10] [COMMANDER] we got to figure

[2025-10-18 22:48:14] [COMMANDER] out like the

[2025-10-18 22:48:38] [COMMANDER] wells fargo

[2025-10-18 22:52:06] [COMMANDER] do the style

[2025-10-18 22:52:18] [COMMANDER] what's the little

[2025-10-18 22:52:30] [COMMANDER] we'll have them retreat back to their spot

[2025-10-18 22:53:26] [COMMANDER] maybe we should pick something to coffee so that

[2025-10-18 22:53:30] [COMMANDER] i like the card

[2025-10-18 22:54:04] [COMMANDER] let's just find a hy

[2025-10-18 22:54:16] [COMMANDER] is the styles that aren't quite op

[2025-10-18 22:54:22] [COMMANDER] from like the 90s can i look the coolest

[2025-10-18 22:54:26] [COMMANDER] but we can put like a digital spin on

[2025-10-18 22:54:40] [COMMANDER] i think we can put a digital spin on these retro art

[2025-10-18 22:54:46] [COMMANDER] hand drawn

[2025-10-18 22:55:45] [COMMANDER] who wrote to weapon enhancement

[2025-10-18 22:58:56] [COMMANDER] i think we got to go collect a bunch of code bases

[2025-10-18 22:59:00] [COMMANDER] find one spot and all the bots

[2025-10-18 22:59:22] [COMMANDER] it's actually kind of a funny thought

[2025-10-18 22:59:29] [COMMANDER] play already coded

[2025-10-18 23:15:26] [COMMANDER] yep if you want to figure out what's best

[2025-10-18 23:15:30] [COMMANDER] and every industry

[2025-10-18 23:16:25] [COMMANDER] can we work on the workspace area real quick

[2025-10-18 23:16:31] [COMMANDER] is there any chance we could switch these five questions to

[2025-10-18 23:16:35] [COMMANDER] look for builders

[2025-10-18 23:16:43] [COMMANDER] questions that are a little bit more wise

[2025-10-18 23:17:36] [COMMANDER] it doesn't look like there's really any way for somebody to get back into their

[2025-10-18 23:17:41] [COMMANDER] i think we need some sort of

[2025-10-18 23:17:51] [COMMANDER] login gate system that we use

[2025-10-18 23:18:04] [COMMANDER] ask me some sort of open source gate code we can copy

[2025-10-18 23:18:10] [COMMANDER] we should figure out where all these

[2025-10-18 23:18:16] [COMMANDER] blueprint

[2025-10-18 23:19:36] [COMMANDER] i've been working on it day and night i'm here working on it now

[2025-10-18 23:23:34] [COMMANDER] hi has never been my superpower

[2025-10-18 23:27:13] [COMMANDER] just making sure you're working

[2025-10-18 23:27:35] [COMMANDER] yeah what kind of controls you got from there

[2025-10-18 23:27:40] [COMMANDER] i'm trying to figure out how i'm going to use you now

[2025-10-18 23:27:50] [COMMANDER] did we get you tied in

[2025-10-18 23:28:25] [COMMANDER] do you have an established whatever connections

[2025-10-18 23:29:20] [COMMANDER] we're going to do that later

[2025-10-18 23:31:58] [COMMANDER] let's make a note on the desktop with that

[2025-10-18 23:33:59] [COMMANDER] okay great

[2025-10-18 23:34:04] [COMMANDER] i'm talking to him on the interface

[2025-10-18 23:34:11] [COMMANDER] how hard is it to get it to where you can

[2025-10-18 23:34:15] [COMMANDER] pass things back and

[2025-10-18 23:34:30] [COMMANDER] i pasted some code on the desk

[2025-10-18 23:34:46] [COMMANDER] okay i got it on the desktop

[2025-10-18 23:40:09] [COMMANDER] let's figure out what kind of connections we can make

[2025-10-18 23:40:34] [COMMANDER] i feel like you got to show gpt the system

[2025-10-18 23:40:48] [COMMANDER] what does opinion

[2025-10-18 23:40:52] [COMMANDER] move forward

[2025-10-18 23:41:31] [COMMANDER] maybe he's like the supercharger

[2025-10-18 23:41:34] [COMMANDER] what is the three turbos

[2025-10-18 23:43:29] [COMMANDER] cuz we would have all the meta documents all

[2025-10-18 23:43:32] [COMMANDER] play prince

[2025-10-18 23:44:27] [COMMANDER] yo

[2025-10-18 23:44:43] [COMMANDER] claude code all tied in together

[2025-10-18 23:44:43] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-18 23:44:48] [CLAUDE] I didn't hear a command. Try again.

[2025-10-18 23:44:58] [COMMANDER] gpt pasted it some sort of relay

[2025-10-18 23:45:01] [COMMANDER] put it on the desktop

[2025-10-18 23:45:05] [COMMANDER] tie

[2025-10-18 23:45:36] [COMMANDER] yeah we're doing that also

[2025-10-18 23:52:50] [COMMANDER] wait so i could use you

[2025-10-18 23:53:23] [COMMANDER] okay send a message emergency

[2025-10-18 23:56:17] [COMMANDER] no i'm on my desktop what did you want me to do with it

[2025-10-18 23:57:08] [COMMANDER] sure

[2025-10-19 00:03:31] [COMMANDER] yo what's up dude i'm tying all

[2025-10-19 00:03:43] [COMMANDER] do you want to work get into a workspace

[2025-10-19 00:03:47] [COMMANDER] 10

[2025-10-19 00:06:18] [COMMANDER] play

[2025-10-19 00:09:07] [COMMANDER] hey claude

[2025-10-19 00:09:07] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-19 00:09:12] [COMMANDER] how do we download code on

[2025-10-19 00:09:12] [CLAUDE] Command received: how do we download code on. I'm still learning new commands. Try asking about status, deploy, payment, cloud, or cockpit.

[2025-10-19 00:09:16] [COMMANDER] claude code

[2025-10-19 00:09:16] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-19 00:09:20] [CLAUDE] I didn't hear a command. Try again.

[2025-10-19 00:12:09] [COMMANDER] okay i bought a second account

[2025-10-19 00:12:13] [COMMANDER] through anthrop

[2025-10-19 00:12:21] [COMMANDER] it's on the same computer

[2025-10-19 00:12:29] [COMMANDER] change to say download claude code

[2025-10-19 00:12:29] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-19 00:12:32] [CLAUDE] I didn't hear a command. Try again.

[2025-10-19 00:12:48] [COMMANDER] so i wonder how it's going to tell which accounts because now

[2025-10-19 00:12:54] [COMMANDER] what is it cuz it looks like it's using my ip address to

[2025-10-19 00:13:02] [COMMANDER] still says approaching weekly limit so it thinks i'm on my other account so i guess

[2025-10-19 00:13:05] [COMMANDER] dakota counts on the same

[2025-10-19 00:13:11] [COMMANDER] how do we get to start pulling credits from the other account

[2025-10-19 00:14:07] [COMMANDER] play focus on what you feel is most important

[2025-10-19 00:14:11] [COMMANDER] why don't you take a break

[2025-10-19 00:14:14] [COMMANDER] who is impossible

[2025-10-19 00:14:24] [COMMANDER] i also got a couple guys coming

[2025-10-19 00:14:34] [COMMANDER] how many hundreds of seduced can

[2025-10-19 00:14:41] [COMMANDER] how many large ticket items can

[2025-10-19 00:15:37] [COMMANDER] you can kind of look at our current to-do list

[2025-10-19 00:15:41] [COMMANDER] almost make like a timeline trajectory

[2025-10-19 00:15:47] [COMMANDER] split it up into what we need done in this next week

[2025-10-19 00:15:53] [COMMANDER] it's almost like i need to be signing up

[2025-10-19 00:16:03] [COMMANDER] maybe we can figure out a way to get the ais to be able to sign up for apis

[2025-10-19 00:16:18] [COMMANDER] go make a playground for breaking captions
