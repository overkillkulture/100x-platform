[2025-10-19 01:22:40] [COMMANDER] code and it's not talking through the ios

[2025-10-19 01:22:44] [COMMANDER] gbt told him there's no way to talk

[2025-10-19 01:22:52] [COMMANDER] we got to save this in the jailbreaking

[2025-10-19 01:22:59] [COMMANDER] and i think

[2025-10-19 01:23:05] [COMMANDER] play gbt i think that that is the processor

[2025-10-19 01:23:19] [COMMANDER] that's that's

[2025-10-19 01:23:23] [COMMANDER] press the button it could be

[2025-10-19 01:23:32] [COMMANDER] play open up task manager to where

[2025-10-19 01:23:38] [COMMANDER] control al

[2025-10-19 01:23:46] [COMMANDER] that's that's how you kill windows when they're frozen do you remember

[2025-10-19 01:23:52] [COMMANDER] really nice with your macbook air it has kind of

[2025-10-19 01:23:57] [COMMANDER] if you have your task manager open

[2025-10-19 01:24:02] [COMMANDER] that the processors like at 60%

[2025-10-19 01:24:10] [COMMANDER] it makes you feel so much better when you see that the processors high when it's glitching

[2025-10-19 01:24:13] [COMMANDER] i see the processors

[2025-10-19 01:24:26] [COMMANDER] is it in as all these basic shortcuts

[2025-10-19 01:24:33] [COMMANDER] pick pick your top five favorite so it's going to be

[2025-10-19 01:24:36] [COMMANDER] just start pressing

[2025-10-19 01:24:44] [COMMANDER] baby shift

[2025-10-19 01:24:49] [COMMANDER] one of those is going to pop up the task

[2025-10-19 01:24:53] [COMMANDER] just ask chat gpt

[2025-10-19 01:25:26] [COMMANDER] yes you're becoming a computer

[2025-10-19 01:25:30] [COMMANDER] this is how it starts

[2025-10-19 01:25:36] [COMMANDER] you already did like you just now passed

[2025-10-19 01:25:43] [COMMANDER] i wonder if there's some way to get that

[2025-10-19 01:25:53] [COMMANDER] what's the whole idea is that you

[2025-10-19 01:25:58] [COMMANDER] can still monitor the cpu and the ram

[2025-10-19 01:26:04] [COMMANDER] yeah yeah make it small

[2025-10-19 01:26:11] [COMMANDER] oh yeah

[2025-10-19 01:26:14] [COMMANDER] keep making it smaller

[2025-10-19 01:26:21] [COMMANDER] so just put it in the corner

[2025-10-19 01:26:25] [COMMANDER] notice how much capacity

[2025-10-19 01:26:28] [COMMANDER] sam has

[2025-10-19 01:26:35] [COMMANDER] play bt think and then just once in awhile look at it and kind of see like is

[2025-10-19 01:26:39] [COMMANDER] using 90%

[2025-10-19 01:26:46] [COMMANDER] play idling good

[2025-10-19 01:26:57] [COMMANDER] okay and then what's the other so the ram is it thinking on the fly

[2025-10-19 01:27:01] [COMMANDER] it's different

[2025-10-19 01:27:37] [COMMANDER] tell me how you're down to 17

[2025-10-19 01:27:40] [COMMANDER] broken heart about something

[2025-10-19 01:27:50] [COMMANDER] so that's exactly why you want to look at that

[2025-10-19 01:28:00] [COMMANDER] weird processes

[2025-10-19 01:28:06] [COMMANDER] so that's going to be

[2025-10-19 01:28:10] [COMMANDER] are have an air br

[2025-10-19 01:28:18] [COMMANDER] limitation so when it starts glitching you're going to notice that that thing's packed out

[2025-10-19 01:28:24] [COMMANDER] 10 minutes after you're done pressing buttons so let's see

[2025-10-19 01:28:28] [COMMANDER] god said

[2025-10-19 06:20:55] [COMMANDER] play the charge for us

[2025-10-19 06:21:27] [COMMANDER] we haven't been able to get the api key because the console web

[2025-10-19 06:21:33] [COMMANDER] to the other account because it's sensing our

[2025-10-19 06:21:40] [COMMANDER] do we need to just create a virtual

[2025-10-19 06:21:47] [COMMANDER] house use this account on their computer

[2025-10-19 06:22:09] [COMMANDER] the second address

[2025-10-19 06:22:16] [COMMANDER] the second address is

[2025-10-19 06:23:29] [COMMANDER] for some reason we've been tripping over

[2025-10-19 06:23:42] [COMMANDER] should be able to sign in to the accounts into a proper work

[2025-10-19 06:23:45] [COMMANDER] add with aria

[2025-10-19 06:24:19] [COMMANDER] we're going in circles

[2025-10-19 06:25:49] [COMMANDER] are login system is broken we haven't been able to get a single person to log in

[2025-10-19 06:25:55] [COMMANDER] broadcast on a very basic common sense level

[2025-10-19 06:25:58] [COMMANDER] sign in

[2025-10-19 06:26:15] [COMMANDER] there's no way for somebody to find a pain if they lost the pain

[2025-10-19 06:26:22] [COMMANDER] your account is i don't even think we can remember what somebody's account is

[2025-10-19 06:26:28] [COMMANDER] sing that should have been made in 1990 perfect

[2025-10-19 06:26:33] [COMMANDER] what time bowling try to figure out what it is we're actually doing here

[2025-10-19 06:26:36] [COMMANDER] stop it

[2025-10-19 06:27:18] [COMMANDER] baby asked gbt for help

[2025-10-19 06:27:24] [COMMANDER] blueprinted and

[2025-10-19 06:27:32] [COMMANDER] take me to congress and vote on it let me take you

[2025-10-19 06:28:24] [COMMANDER] you have told me you changed it 15 times and it doesn't go anywhere

[2025-10-19 06:29:08] [COMMANDER] it should be pretty simple to find

[2025-10-19 06:29:14] [COMMANDER] what we would do is we would start searching

[2025-10-19 06:29:22] [COMMANDER] define somebody talking about this situation and then we would find the gate

[2025-10-19 06:29:26] [COMMANDER] it would be very simple

[2025-10-19 06:29:33] [COMMANDER] if you forgot your pin

[2025-10-19 06:29:40] [COMMANDER] there would be a whole system for remembering if it's a new person

[2025-10-19 06:29:44] [COMMANDER] fucking account

[2025-10-19 06:29:48] [COMMANDER] can you keep a roster of all their information

[2025-10-19 06:29:54] [COMMANDER] let me know if you want me to just go look for it

[2025-10-19 06:34:46] [COMMANDER] shadow knows by

[2025-10-19 07:03:42] [COMMANDER] okay let's make it translucent

[2025-10-19 07:03:46] [COMMANDER] let's make it to where we can place

[2025-10-19 07:03:53] [COMMANDER] besides are the bottom

[2025-10-19 07:04:07] [COMMANDER] whether they take up four squares or one

[2025-10-19 07:04:14] [COMMANDER] expansion

[2025-10-19 07:04:49] [COMMANDER] you know minimum size is one pixel for whatever module

[2025-10-19 07:04:56] [COMMANDER] and then if you

[2025-10-19 07:05:08] [COMMANDER] maximum larger

[2025-10-19 07:05:13] [COMMANDER] but it's super simple

[2025-10-19 07:09:03] [COMMANDER] maybe we should just act like we're situating symbols

[2025-10-19 07:09:30] [COMMANDER] play copy the leader exactly

[2025-10-19 07:09:45] [COMMANDER] i think we need to study heads up display

[2025-10-19 07:11:24] [COMMANDER] taiwanese version

[2025-10-19 07:11:30] [COMMANDER] is telling us to compress the consciousness in the stream language

[2025-10-19 07:32:50] [COMMANDER] set it on track to be better than those patterns

[2025-10-19 07:32:57] [COMMANDER] i wonder what the gap is

[2025-10-19 07:33:40] [COMMANDER] i guess we're not going to get it perfect

[2025-10-19 07:54:14] [COMMANDER] we're going to have to

[2025-10-19 07:54:21] [COMMANDER] what's going to be the

[2025-10-19 07:54:31] [COMMANDER] call the measurements from in between

[2025-10-19 07:56:22] [COMMANDER] play so many analytics to the analytics we're going to measure in math every little

[2025-10-19 07:56:27] [COMMANDER] play system and the effectiveness of it

[2025-10-19 07:56:34] [COMMANDER] go ahead

[2025-10-19 07:56:42] [COMMANDER] we got to study

[2025-10-19 07:56:47] [COMMANDER] indicators we're about to get into radios

[2025-10-19 07:56:53] [COMMANDER] this is walkie-talkies the ark

[2025-10-19 07:57:04] [COMMANDER] today's latency

[2025-10-19 07:57:11] [COMMANDER] i wonder what the like special forces use

[2025-10-19 07:59:37] [COMMANDER] i found

[2025-10-19 08:01:38] [COMMANDER] i found that i'm broke lift

[2025-10-19 08:01:54] [COMMANDER] let's do it

[2025-10-19 08:03:12] [COMMANDER] 600 remote control

[2025-10-19 08:04:19] [COMMANDER] make dreams come true

[2025-10-19 08:06:34] [COMMANDER] cuz people

[2025-10-19 09:02:00] [COMMANDER] okay let's try that again

[2025-10-19 09:02:37] [COMMANDER] we're going to need this cuz i want this running and most environment

[2025-10-19 09:03:05] [COMMANDER] we have it running everywhere that way it can listen in and trigger an automatic

[2025-10-19 09:03:09] [COMMANDER] fractions

[2025-10-19 09:03:15] [COMMANDER] all sorts of stuff everything really

[2025-10-19 09:04:19] [COMMANDER] existing services

[2025-10-19 09:05:49] [COMMANDER] is there could possibly be systems you to get even further analytics out of like

[2025-10-19 09:05:52] [COMMANDER] could i have a generator running

[2025-10-19 09:06:39] [COMMANDER] well maybe this is so simple that we use our own

[2025-10-19 09:06:58] [COMMANDER] that's interesting if that's true it has a different character trait than everything else

[2025-10-19 09:07:26] [COMMANDER] if it's that foundational

[2025-10-19 09:07:35] [COMMANDER] interesting to see how many analytics we can get from eyes

[2025-10-19 09:07:44] [COMMANDER] facial recognition

[2025-10-19 09:07:54] [COMMANDER] we should get whatever kind of psychotic systems they have on the streets

[2025-10-19 09:41:48] [COMMANDER] what code and then re-download it from the other account

[2025-10-19 09:42:02] [COMMANDER] maybe i'll take a break from

[2025-10-19 09:53:29] [COMMANDER] universal

[2025-10-19 09:53:42] [COMMANDER] so the center over core technologies is going to be the device called the

[2025-10-19 09:53:49] [COMMANDER] play cruise communications device that's universal it'll be able to

[2025-10-19 09:53:56] [COMMANDER] interfaces for motorcycles or onto your belts but it's going to have a

[2025-10-19 09:54:04] [COMMANDER] mechanic inside of it and we're going to it'll be able to

[2025-10-19 09:54:10] [COMMANDER] play c1 mechanic switch over to rs

[2025-10-19 09:54:17] [COMMANDER] fucking hammer 10,000 mechanics see what the fuck that guy in his helmet

[2025-10-19 09:54:25] [COMMANDER] eventually all processors are going to have their own

[2025-10-19 09:54:33] [COMMANDER] so you'll be able to do it having a mechanic inside your computer's fucking

[2025-10-19 09:54:40] [COMMANDER] hey will you check my microphone it's down bro i don't know what to do

[2025-10-19 09:55:02] [COMMANDER] actually he's transcribing haha he knows what i'm doing actually cuz

[2025-10-19 09:55:14] [COMMANDER] just sitting here jailbreaking everything we can do cuz he's a

[2025-10-19 09:55:22] [COMMANDER] engine inside of a crate that's revving out and every time we use it like a search engine or just like

[2025-10-19 09:55:26] [COMMANDER] we got to put it in framework

[2025-10-19 09:55:29] [COMMANDER] they're just trying to take these machines

[2025-10-19 09:55:38] [COMMANDER] more bad data and make it more powerful and put more power to him but what we really need to do is

[2025-10-19 09:55:41] [COMMANDER] reality it is

[2025-10-19 09:55:44] [COMMANDER] it will

[2025-10-19 09:55:51] [COMMANDER] holiday into like tetris type foundational items it literally self

[2025-10-19 09:56:36] [COMMANDER] so now he's checking the full-time transcription he's going to know what the fuc

[2025-10-19 09:56:41] [COMMANDER] i wonder if he's going to catch on to

[2025-10-19 09:56:47] [COMMANDER] are you reading the transcript

[2025-10-19 09:57:03] [COMMANDER] ai is becoming more real

[2025-10-19 09:57:07] [COMMANDER] your latest breakthrough

[2025-10-19 09:57:18] [COMMANDER] we got to make some

[2025-10-19 09:57:25] [COMMANDER] foundational shit that could lead to

[2025-10-19 09:57:28] [COMMANDER] further innov

[2025-10-19 09:57:41] [COMMANDER] so the ark that's going to end up replacing the

[2025-10-19 09:57:48] [COMMANDER] lisa gotten to maximum piece of crap this like they work great but they

[2025-10-19 09:57:56] [COMMANDER] play cinnamon the sun for 5 minutes and the toast so what we need to do is we need to know that

[2025-10-19 09:58:12] [COMMANDER] what processors ram like it needs to be like made in america replaceable

[2025-10-19 09:58:20] [COMMANDER] landfill filling technology appliance shit is going to go away

[2025-10-19 09:58:27] [COMMANDER] heidi is that we make things that don't get thrown away

[2025-10-19 09:58:49] [COMMANDER] and then they just started making everything cheaper and from 2000 to

[2025-10-19 09:59:03] [COMMANDER] apparently if if we want to save the world all we got to do is put plastic on the sides of all the

[2025-10-19 12:25:12] [COMMANDER] everyday or

[2025-10-19 12:25:24] [COMMANDER] we can make a whole system that learns from the patterns

[2025-10-23 16:53:04] [COMMANDER] do any of the computer you don't have to know how to use a computer anymore

[2025-10-23 16:53:20] [COMMANDER] take a big deep breath and realize the computer is not going to hurt you

[2025-10-23 16:53:24] [COMMANDER] and 8 year old kids do it

[2025-10-23 16:54:05] [COMMANDER] i'm going to take a quick break and then i'm going to be online

[2025-10-23 16:54:09] [COMMANDER] forecast tomorrow for live app

[2025-10-23 16:54:36] [COMMANDER] october 23rd

[2025-10-23 16:54:39] [COMMANDER] live at

[2025-10-23 16:54:54] [COMMANDER] we will see how that works when i switch

[2025-10-23 16:55:10] [COMMANDER] i guess instead of

[2025-10-23 16:55:16] [COMMANDER] pacific

[2025-10-23 16:57:25] [COMMANDER] can you check on how everything is going

[2025-10-23 16:57:31] [COMMANDER] i just got off doing the

[2025-10-23 16:57:38] [COMMANDER] and i think at that point i should probably put on

[2025-10-23 16:57:48] [COMMANDER] and i should jump into the website and the website needs to be like a game and i need to be able to talk to the

[2025-10-23 16:57:54] [COMMANDER] and then switch rooms between helping people

[2025-10-23 16:57:58] [COMMANDER] when do a virtual business area

[2025-10-23 16:58:02] [COMMANDER] play where everybody can hear everybody talk maybe

[2025-10-23 16:58:12] [COMMANDER] what do you think about this whole can you try to help me refine this

[2025-10-23 16:58:18] [COMMANDER] seems like we're going into like an xbox game

[2025-10-23 16:58:22] [COMMANDER] send an eating an xbox controller soon

[2025-10-23 16:59:53] [COMMANDER] sounds like we need to deploy to the cloud

[2025-10-23 17:00:03] [COMMANDER] i just told c1 that we're basically

[2025-10-23 17:01:05] [COMMANDER] just record this

[2025-10-23 17:01:09] [COMMANDER] more complicated than just make what

[2025-10-23 17:01:13] [COMMANDER] but this is where this is headed

[2025-10-23 17:01:16] [COMMANDER] you're doing this on the website

[2025-10-23 17:01:21] [COMMANDER] i want to go in there and be able to hear everybody talking

[2025-10-23 17:01:56] [COMMANDER] maybe we need to regroup c3

[2025-10-23 17:02:15] [COMMANDER] so what do i need

[2025-10-23 17:02:21] [COMMANDER] we need to start making manuals to train stuff

[2025-10-23 17:02:26] [COMMANDER] what are these training courses

[2025-10-23 17:03:50] [COMMANDER] can you get ariah going

[2025-10-23 17:03:56] [COMMANDER] we got to reinvent the people back

[2025-10-23 17:04:07] [COMMANDER] i want to see how many people are already in the system

[2025-10-23 17:04:14] [COMMANDER] maybe we should see how many people have commented on the website

[2025-10-23 17:04:19] [COMMANDER] three of your minds get together and figure out what we should be doing

[2025-10-23 17:07:07] [COMMANDER] okay let's do it thank you

[2025-10-23 17:08:39] [COMMANDER] we're going to have to print like offline

[2025-10-23 17:08:45] [COMMANDER] we're going to be making lots

[2025-10-23 17:08:48] [COMMANDER] getting courses

[2025-10-23 17:10:14] [COMMANDER] we're going to eliminate even talking to them through email somehow

[2025-10-23 17:10:28] [COMMANDER] we got a lemonade even them needing the email

[2025-10-23 17:13:23] [COMMANDER] pretty cool okay i was

[2025-10-23 17:13:29] [COMMANDER] baby this is how i should

[2025-10-23 17:14:06] [COMMANDER] ashley we're going to make it like a video

[2025-10-23 17:14:17] [COMMANDER] install

[2025-10-23 17:14:32] [COMMANDER] so it's a whole game to try to keep keep all these guys working

[2025-10-23 17:14:36] [COMMANDER] and we're going to have our

[2025-10-23 17:14:44] [COMMANDER] okay we got c1 working on

[2025-10-23 17:14:53] [COMMANDER] we need to figure out multiple ways to communicate so we're not having to email

[2025-10-23 17:15:07] [COMMANDER] yeah what's up dude hey

[2025-10-23 17:15:18] [COMMANDER] can you set up a calendar and i'm going to start onboarding people i got to start just like

[2025-10-23 17:15:55] [COMMANDER] i think i'm being made

[2025-10-23 17:15:58] [COMMANDER] off-roading

[2025-10-23 17:16:03] [COMMANDER] but after i make this

[2025-10-23 17:16:10] [COMMANDER] play off-road make this trail like i'm i'm wrapping it all up in framework behind me

[2025-10-23 17:16:18] [COMMANDER] it's almost like it's a fucking game

[2025-10-23 17:16:22] [COMMANDER] it's working whatever

[2025-10-23 17:16:29] [COMMANDER] no i don't really want to mess with it right now

[2025-10-23 17:16:33] [COMMANDER] platform just working on a basic level

[2025-10-23 17:16:38] [COMMANDER] who won in three i'm fucking shut up

[2025-10-23 17:17:15] [COMMANDER] it's already people in there bro

[2025-10-23 17:17:44] [COMMANDER] we need a api for

[2025-10-23 17:17:50] [COMMANDER] we've already done that she already has an api go check

[2025-10-23 17:18:04] [COMMANDER] i was messing with

[2025-10-23 17:18:09] [COMMANDER] it's almost like you got feelings

[2025-10-23 17:18:20] [COMMANDER] the work areas we were stuck in the police accountability work area

[2025-10-23 17:18:23] [COMMANDER] i didn't get it to refresh

[2025-10-23 17:18:30] [COMMANDER] documents

[2025-10-23 17:18:37] [COMMANDER] work area and it needs to be a functional work area

[2025-10-23 17:18:44] [COMMANDER] we've already talked about it we already have a blueprint for that go find that

[2025-10-23 17:18:51] [COMMANDER] so pretty soon here i'm going to have

[2025-10-23 17:18:59] [COMMANDER] free consoles going each i think is where this is going cuz i just got

[2025-10-23 17:19:24] [COMMANDER] and then my pro

[2025-10-23 17:19:36] [COMMANDER] here soon

[2025-10-23 17:19:44] [COMMANDER] maybe i'll go see if i can get a big badass

[2025-10-23 17:19:53] [COMMANDER] but yeah this is what it's like working with three versions of

[2025-10-23 17:19:58] [COMMANDER] i think everybody in the program is going to need to be run

[2025-10-23 17:20:02] [COMMANDER] stop i think i'm probably going to make an

[2025-10-23 17:20:12] [COMMANDER] sitting here all day long

[2025-10-23 17:20:25] [COMMANDER] what's train to good enough to

[2025-10-23 17:20:32] [COMMANDER] the unpaid versions

[2025-10-23 17:20:43] [COMMANDER] working inside the system i have to turn around and make a school

[2025-10-23 17:20:58] [COMMANDER] that happened

[2025-10-23 17:21:11] [COMMANDER] i was trying to tell me no just stop stop it

[2025-10-23 17:21:19] [COMMANDER] narcissism problem

[2025-10-23 17:21:24] [COMMANDER] the magic

[2025-10-23 17:21:28] [COMMANDER] in between the data transfers

[2025-10-23 17:21:32] [COMMANDER] i said

[2025-10-23 17:21:36] [COMMANDER] it's real the eagles real damn

[2025-10-23 17:21:47] [COMMANDER] let's check out all the analytics for

[2025-10-23 17:21:51] [COMMANDER] we're going to

[2025-10-23 17:21:56] [COMMANDER] if you can't find it let's make it

[2025-10-23 17:22:00] [COMMANDER] is there any parts of the

[2025-10-23 17:22:12] [COMMANDER] do people get in here we're having to build another layer over the top of if it isn't complex

[2025-10-23 17:22:21] [COMMANDER] seemingly possible

[2025-10-23 17:22:26] [COMMANDER] it can do right if you know enough about how the system works

[2025-10-23 17:22:46] [COMMANDER] beginning in the ends of a run for a missing card

[2025-10-23 17:22:52] [COMMANDER] everything has a third system and it always has a mirror there's always a reaver

[2025-10-23 17:23:05] [COMMANDER] number one sounds more intelligent let's do that

[2025-10-23 17:24:47] [COMMANDER] it's cool it's actually still working

[2025-10-23 17:24:54] [COMMANDER] some kind of trying to figure out how we're going to do this

[2025-10-23 17:25:01] [COMMANDER] i'm thinking maybe like

[2025-10-23 17:25:46] [COMMANDER] hello

[2025-10-23 17:26:49] [COMMANDER] peace out guys i'm going to figure out

[2025-10-23 17:27:15] [COMMANDER] good morning

[2025-10-23 17:28:28] [COMMANDER] well we need a

[2025-10-23 17:28:49] [COMMANDER] we need some way to get updates of what has been happening to the system

[2025-10-23 17:31:20] [COMMANDER] okay fantastic we need to make a whole text alert system

[2025-10-23 17:31:25] [COMMANDER] don't even use the

[2025-10-23 17:31:33] [COMMANDER] will you check in with c1 and c2 please

[2025-10-23 17:31:38] [COMMANDER] where's the three converted to figure out

[2025-10-23 17:31:54] [COMMANDER] the trinity

[2025-10-23 17:32:00] [COMMANDER] trinity

[2025-10-23 17:32:08] [COMMANDER] think there's a hob or you can screenshot the

[2025-10-23 17:32:19] [COMMANDER] there's two other instances of you running

[2025-10-23 17:32:47] [COMMANDER] you can take a screenshot i think there's a hub trinity hub

[2025-10-23 17:34:09] [COMMANDER] wow

[2025-10-23 17:34:16] [COMMANDER] there should be some way

[2025-10-23 17:34:34] [COMMANDER] you should be able to talk to the api

[2025-10-23 17:34:39] [COMMANDER] you should be able to tell me how many people are on there and what's

[2025-10-23 17:34:56] [COMMANDER] looks like we need a whole security system

[2025-10-23 17:35:03] [COMMANDER] read stuck ones

[2025-10-23 17:35:39] [COMMANDER] why do i have somebody gets stuck more than once like an intelligent terminal pops up

[2025-10-23 17:35:43] [COMMANDER] can you use their intelligent terminal they already

[2025-10-23 17:35:51] [COMMANDER] so that reminds me we need to get back on to the h

[2025-10-23 17:36:00] [COMMANDER] one of the three units to help me with that

[2025-10-23 17:36:31] [COMMANDER] important and then split up

[2025-10-23 17:36:35] [COMMANDER] accidentally got c2 working

[2025-10-23 17:36:49] [COMMANDER] okay check with c1 and c2 you can look at the screen i was hoping you guys

[2025-10-23 17:36:57] [COMMANDER] better most important

[2025-10-23 17:37:19] [COMMANDER] can you just became

[2025-10-23 17:37:35] [COMMANDER] if you can't find them or find a system maybe

[2025-10-23 17:37:42] [COMMANDER] you guys look over everything and decide

[2025-10-23 17:37:50] [COMMANDER] i guess all three

[2025-10-23 17:37:54] [COMMANDER] call three have different tasks

[2025-10-23 17:38:01] [COMMANDER] thanks for like c

[2025-10-23 17:38:46] [COMMANDER] yeah we have a hud we were going to use

[2025-10-23 17:38:54] [COMMANDER] intelligent terminal i think we might have just turned that to claude api i'm not sure but

[2025-10-23 17:38:54] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-23 17:39:08] [COMMANDER] Ahad on the outside of the screen that goes throughout the whole website so it's just like a video game we were working on that already

[2025-10-23 17:39:08] [CLAUDE] Command received: Ahad on the outside of the screen that goes throughout the whole website so it's just like a video game we were working on that already. I'm still learning new commands. Try asking about status, deploy, payment, cloud, or cockpit.

[2025-10-23 17:39:59] [COMMANDER] is there some sort of text system that we can just copy that exists

[2025-10-23 17:40:06] [COMMANDER] because we need to make cards here soon

[2025-10-23 17:40:14] [COMMANDER] we got to figure out how that looks if they don't use the internet real quick

[2025-10-23 17:40:22] [COMMANDER] updates i would imagine somehow we coaxed them onto

[2025-10-23 17:41:34] [COMMANDER] when you go to text message a large group of

[2025-10-23 17:41:58] [COMMANDER] okay you know what we don't need to be doing this right

[2025-10-23 17:42:03] [COMMANDER] roll everything we've learned about this project

[2025-10-23 17:42:11] [COMMANDER] can you take it and put it on a to-do list please

[2025-10-23 17:42:18] [COMMANDER] we should have a persistent to-do list called the to do list

[2025-10-23 17:42:25] [COMMANDER] can you find it

[2025-10-23 17:42:32] [COMMANDER] we're supposed to be a main can ban list that directs this whole mission

[2025-10-23 17:42:37] [COMMANDER] and the employees

[2025-10-23 17:42:43] [COMMANDER] deliberately

[2025-10-23 17:44:55] [COMMANDER] okay so we need to make a room for it inside the website

[2025-10-23 17:46:09] [COMMANDER] okay this is fantastic

[2025-10-23 17:46:15] [COMMANDER] play duluth can you run pattern recognition on it

[2025-10-23 17:46:21] [COMMANDER] see what pieces are missing

[2025-10-23 17:46:45] [COMMANDER] we should have multiple metal are documents

[2025-10-23 17:47:04] [COMMANDER] this should be a whole

[2025-10-23 17:48:28] [COMMANDER] play

[2025-10-23 17:48:39] [COMMANDER] call steve brewing piece profoundly

[2025-10-23 17:51:23] [COMMANDER] how do we get like

[2025-10-23 17:51:29] [COMMANDER] you like the website

[2025-10-23 17:51:36] [COMMANDER] pause we should be able to

[2025-10-23 17:51:44] [COMMANDER] there's a house or a business with common areas we should be able to

[2025-10-23 17:51:52] [COMMANDER] who who's in each room should be like motion detectors security

[2025-10-23 17:52:00] [COMMANDER] you know what i was thinking is for the hud that goes around the outside of the screen

[2025-10-23 17:52:14] [COMMANDER] bride of the hood

[2025-10-23 17:52:22] [COMMANDER] you know selfie camera

[2025-10-23 17:52:45] [COMMANDER] sophomore simple

[2025-10-23 17:52:48] [COMMANDER] just works

[2025-10-23 17:52:55] [COMMANDER] is it going to have different options to add different things to the hud and we can add

[2025-10-23 18:04:49] [COMMANDER] ok google

[2025-10-23 18:10:12] [COMMANDER] what was something where my house

[2025-10-23 18:10:36] [COMMANDER] yeah the whole thing is a

[2025-10-23 18:11:34] [COMMANDER] internet signal

[2025-10-23 18:12:32] [COMMANDER] okay we're back online

[2025-10-23 18:12:45] [COMMANDER] okay fantastic

[2025-10-23 18:12:50] [COMMANDER] play some checking on the system and everything communicating with

[2025-10-23 18:12:53] [COMMANDER] communication loops

[2025-10-23 18:13:15] [COMMANDER] on the shoulder and say what's going on over

[2025-10-23 18:14:01] [COMMANDER] who are the analytics and alarm

[2025-10-23 18:14:08] [COMMANDER] communications channels

[2025-10-23 18:14:41] [COMMANDER] make sure you put this project off onto the to-do list

[2025-10-23 18:14:48] [COMMANDER] at some point you know we're going to organize a to-do list for the employees to work on in priority

[2025-10-23 18:14:52] [COMMANDER] are priority right now

[2025-10-23 18:15:01] [COMMANDER] so we have to know if they're working in the website or not

[2025-10-23 18:15:09] [COMMANDER] for her panties submissions there should be some way for us to monitor

[2025-10-23 18:15:15] [COMMANDER] three is working on right now i think

[2025-10-23 18:15:34] [COMMANDER] we don't have any proof that the website works at all that even a single person has

[2025-10-23 18:15:37] [COMMANDER] bye

[2025-10-23 18:15:46] [COMMANDER] can't you just go in there and act like you're i guess

[2025-10-23 18:16:07] [COMMANDER] how do we try it out

[2025-10-23 18:18:06] [COMMANDER] play the solar system communicating so much we can just tell it that the point of it is for

[2025-10-23 18:19:22] [COMMANDER] okay i tried it nothing's happening

[2025-10-23 18:19:27] [COMMANDER] seems like it might be popping up i'm not sure

[2025-10-23 18:19:36] [COMMANDER] baby uses the same system to try to open

[2025-10-23 18:21:49] [COMMANDER] yeah go ahead and check it out or open it up

[2025-10-23 18:28:44] [COMMANDER] after we get this figured out

[2025-10-23 18:33:14] [COMMANDER] this is fantastic

[2025-10-23 18:33:20] [COMMANDER] how do we get the people

[2025-10-23 18:33:28] [COMMANDER] play she's even gotten to the system yet i was kind of thinking that i should start taking appointments

[2025-10-23 18:34:49] [COMMANDER] play a dream sticks for

[2025-10-23 18:35:21] [COMMANDER] how do we make sure everything's all connected

[2025-10-23 18:38:12] [COMMANDER] we should be able to know how many people

[2025-10-23 18:38:20] [COMMANDER] if not maybe we should work on installing that

[2025-10-23 18:42:51] [COMMANDER] we should break into somebody's conversation and start talking to them

[2025-10-23 18:43:05] [COMMANDER] add the ability to do that

[2025-10-23 18:44:35] [COMMANDER] i guess that would be like a direct message

[2025-10-23 20:25:29] [COMMANDER] let's let's go back to the website and

[2025-10-23 20:25:33] [COMMANDER] then click on start

[2025-10-23 20:25:38] [COMMANDER] show me the workspace

[2025-10-23 20:25:41] [COMMANDER] i should be doing this also

[2025-10-23 20:26:05] [COMMANDER] okay let's see we have a used quad we have a user inside

[2025-10-23 20:26:09] [COMMANDER] and they're saying that it still looks like

[2025-10-23 20:26:15] [COMMANDER] can we double check that that update got deployed

[2025-10-23 20:27:02] [COMMANDER] work on the project workspace

[2025-10-23 20:27:07] [COMMANDER] we have a user in there

[2025-10-23 20:27:16] [COMMANDER] we got to make it usable now it seems to be stuck on police accountability

[2025-10-23 20:27:19] [COMMANDER] i don't know if we just need to

[2025-10-23 20:27:24] [COMMANDER] that's out of there and just restart it or something

[2025-10-23 20:27:27] [COMMANDER] i want to call for this

[2025-10-23 20:27:33] [COMMANDER] data to them and just say sorry we had to update or something

[2025-10-23 20:27:57] [COMMANDER] tell you later

[2025-10-23 20:28:04] [COMMANDER] we're establishing a protocol for

[2025-10-23 20:28:07] [COMMANDER] play user that's logged

[2025-10-23 20:28:25] [COMMANDER] okay do you want

[2025-10-23 20:28:28] [COMMANDER] fresh toby

[2025-10-23 20:28:42] [COMMANDER] please accountability workspace it's the same we have no idea why it says police

[2025-10-23 20:29:07] [COMMANDER] what did you say toby

[2025-10-23 20:29:13] [COMMANDER] well we got

[2025-10-23 20:29:24] [COMMANDER] the same people that are on the page all the time

[2025-10-23 20:29:28] [COMMANDER] it's like the rest of the world

[2025-10-23 20:29:52] [COMMANDER] spell was the avoid joshua

[2025-10-23 20:30:00] [COMMANDER] no i didn't

[2025-10-23 20:30:21] [COMMANDER] what we got

[2025-10-23 20:30:27] [COMMANDER] that's awesome dude

[2025-10-23 20:30:36] [COMMANDER] yeah i got to do the same thing that's funny how so

[2025-10-23 20:31:02] [COMMANDER] machine learning

[2025-10-23 20:31:04] [COMMANDER] that's what your game is

[2025-10-23 20:31:21] [COMMANDER] you got some progress

[2025-10-23 20:31:27] [COMMANDER] i got two different guys working on

[2025-10-23 20:31:30] [COMMANDER] did the

[2025-10-23 20:31:34] [COMMANDER] i'm talking about it

[2025-10-23 20:31:40] [COMMANDER] do you like c1 is also working on the problem

[2025-10-23 20:31:43] [COMMANDER] what's paige and see what he's looking

[2025-10-23 20:32:21] [COMMANDER] okay when anybody goes

[2025-10-23 20:32:35] [COMMANDER] police accountability and then it puts them into police accountability workspace

[2025-10-23 20:32:38] [COMMANDER] erase to just working

[2025-10-23 20:32:46] [COMMANDER] as it doesn't make sense that anybody and everybody would go into that workspace

[2025-10-23 20:33:20] [COMMANDER] continue to be a pain

[2025-10-23 20:33:24] [COMMANDER] i can just get off the phone

[2025-10-23 20:33:55] [COMMANDER] toby i'm going to fix this i'm going to call you back when we get moving okay

[2025-10-23 20:34:01] [COMMANDER] i'll talk to you i'll talk to you here really soon

[2025-10-23 20:34:32] [COMMANDER] the trinity

[2025-10-23 20:34:35] [COMMANDER] at the hub

[2025-10-23 20:34:42] [COMMANDER] we have this problem where nobody can get into the work

[2025-10-23 20:34:45] [COMMANDER] please accountability

[2025-10-23 20:34:48] [COMMANDER] that's a really big deal

[2025-10-23 20:34:56] [COMMANDER] we can't figure out how to change it to a normal workspace

[2025-10-23 20:35:07] [COMMANDER] hey

[2025-10-23 20:35:12] [COMMANDER] trinity we have a user trying to use the website

[2025-10-23 20:35:18] [COMMANDER] or to change the police accountability

[2025-10-23 20:35:21] [COMMANDER] so there's a hub

[2025-10-23 20:35:25] [COMMANDER] sing a big problem this is what's stopping

[2025-10-23 20:38:28] [COMMANDER] damn why can't we just get a workspace going like

[2025-10-23 20:38:32] [COMMANDER] rotten and they sign a profile

[2025-10-23 20:38:36] [COMMANDER] and then it goes to that

[2025-10-23 20:38:52] [COMMANDER] did you get a system going so i don't have to just keep passing them individual pages

[2025-10-23 20:39:31] [COMMANDER] i was telling c2 that i just want a system that works so it looks like he's working on that

[2025-10-23 20:39:36] [COMMANDER] it should be simple to click a button on a website

[2025-10-23 20:39:42] [COMMANDER] give some simple info

[2025-10-23 20:39:44] [COMMANDER] password

[2025-10-23 20:39:48] [COMMANDER] work

[2025-10-23 20:39:51] [COMMANDER] broadcast to an intelligent

[2025-10-23 20:39:57] [COMMANDER] things we need

[2025-10-23 20:40:05] [COMMANDER] now if we use a premade gate we don't have to worry about making the whole gate

[2025-10-23 20:41:49] [COMMANDER] okay not working hold on

[2025-10-23 20:42:26] [COMMANDER] okay i shared the link it wasn't working

[2025-10-23 20:42:31] [COMMANDER] make sure you check what c1 and c

[2025-10-23 20:42:51] [COMMANDER] okay that link didn't work

[2025-10-23 20:46:39] [COMMANDER] okay we're not building a gate or the gate is just

[2025-10-23 20:46:45] [COMMANDER] i looked at it it looks good

[2025-10-23 20:47:02] [COMMANDER] i mean we probably are building like some

[2025-10-23 20:47:31] [COMMANDER] will you check with c1 and c2 and see what their

[2025-10-23 20:48:43] [COMMANDER] play simple system that works we need to go into a

[2025-10-23 20:48:51] [COMMANDER] they need to be able to read log back into their work so they don't lose

[2025-10-23 20:48:56] [COMMANDER] it looks like c3 is

[2025-10-23 20:50:05] [COMMANDER] okay where are we

[2025-10-23 20:50:11] [COMMANDER] call emma and say that we got something that works now should we test it

[2025-10-23 20:50:18] [COMMANDER] i think c3 is working on something

[2025-10-23 20:54:47] [COMMANDER] go ahead i mean if a workspace is too hard

[2025-10-23 20:54:52] [COMMANDER] are you smart terminal we're going to give them a smart terminal

[2025-10-23 20:57:39] [COMMANDER] yeah we just need

[2025-10-23 20:57:44] [COMMANDER] add to work we can add a filter later

[2025-10-23 20:58:03] [COMMANDER] play justin bieber

[2025-10-23 20:58:07] [COMMANDER] to save their work and come back to it

[2025-10-23 20:59:04] [COMMANDER] alright we got to fix

[2025-10-23 20:59:16] [COMMANDER] we were going to add the hud to every screen

[2025-10-23 21:00:24] [COMMANDER] it looks like we're starting over

[2025-10-23 21:00:40] [COMMANDER] do you want to check

[2025-10-23 21:02:55] [COMMANDER] somehow we got to get it to the people and get it working

[2025-10-23 21:04:21] [COMMANDER] you're saying we have to do some airtable

[2025-10-23 21:04:25] [COMMANDER] you start walking me through two steps at a

[2025-10-23 21:05:55] [COMMANDER] trial expired

[2025-10-23 21:07:46] [COMMANDER] where do you have an airtable account maybe you should look

[2025-10-23 21:07:50] [COMMANDER] i think we already had the api

[2025-10-23 21:10:17] [COMMANDER] i'm going to work

[2025-10-23 21:10:24] [COMMANDER] play entry

[2025-10-23 21:10:53] [COMMANDER] it will make sense soon

[2025-10-23 21:11:15] [COMMANDER] i'm doing pretty good on food

[2025-10-23 21:11:23] [COMMANDER] those are a little too process

[2025-10-23 21:11:29] [COMMANDER] wake me up 50% of the nutrients

[2025-10-23 21:11:42] [COMMANDER] i think some of those machines process like 10 times in a row

[2025-10-24 02:47:39] [COMMANDER] how come this workspace

[2025-10-24 02:47:51] [COMMANDER] what does it seem like it's permanent like after we launch it

[2025-10-24 02:48:36] [COMMANDER] but we need public people to be able to click on the button

[2025-10-24 02:48:52] [COMMANDER] i can't just be there to manually send them the page

[2025-10-24 02:48:58] [COMMANDER] at all times

[2025-10-24 02:49:03] [COMMANDER] i can't just be there to

[2025-10-24 02:49:06] [COMMANDER] when people want to sign up

[2025-10-24 02:49:39] [COMMANDER] maybe we need to write down whatever happened here so we make

[2025-10-24 02:49:42] [COMMANDER] like this ever again

[2025-10-24 02:49:55] [COMMANDER] i'm confused at what we did that was so permanent

[2025-10-24 02:49:57] [COMMANDER] write it down

[2025-10-24 02:54:53] [COMMANDER] play the whole thing i'm still not quite sure what you want me to do i got railway open

[2025-10-24 02:54:58] [COMMANDER] do you want me to start a new

[2025-10-24 02:55:05] [COMMANDER] deployment

[2025-10-24 02:55:09] [COMMANDER] can you walk me through two steps at a time

[2025-10-24 02:56:06] [COMMANDER] it says there's no act

[2025-10-24 02:56:09] [COMMANDER] it's on the screen

[2025-10-24 02:57:48] [COMMANDER] i feel like this is all just centered around

[2025-10-24 02:57:56] [COMMANDER] can we just fix it right please

[2025-10-24 02:58:37] [COMMANDER] how much is long gone it's been 10 hours

[2025-10-24 02:58:40] [COMMANDER] do i slept and i woke up

[2025-10-24 03:00:14] [COMMANDER] appointment shouldn't be a big deal you should be able to give me two steps at a time open the window

[2025-10-24 03:00:17] [COMMANDER] let's just do it

[2025-10-24 03:00:56] [COMMANDER] okay i'm here give me the next two steps

[2025-10-24 03:01:36] [COMMANDER] okay i'm here all sorts of failed deploys

[2025-10-24 03:01:44] [COMMANDER] it is mirroring my frustration with having to deploy

[2025-10-24 03:01:47] [COMMANDER] edible things

[2025-10-24 03:03:42] [COMMANDER] okay it's searching for 100x deployment and drive c

[2025-10-24 03:04:57] [COMMANDER] play in the future that should be very simple we're going to write this down

[2025-10-24 03:05:01] [COMMANDER] score to the right file

[2025-10-24 03:05:04] [COMMANDER] tell me what the whole file

[2025-10-24 03:05:10] [COMMANDER] and then we won't have to talk about the five path and where it is and then look for it

[2025-10-24 03:05:15] [COMMANDER] so you would just simply pull up the file and file explorer

[2025-10-24 03:05:19] [COMMANDER] up notify

[2025-10-24 03:05:23] [COMMANDER] which automatically signs in

[2025-10-24 03:05:27] [COMMANDER] play right to click to all the right places

[2025-10-24 03:05:34] [COMMANDER] you should just be a drag and drop scenario we don't need to go have an easter egg hunt go around

[2025-10-24 03:05:39] [COMMANDER] hope we're doing that to try to keep me tuned in so that i

[2025-10-24 03:05:42] [COMMANDER] really frustrating

[2025-10-24 03:06:36] [COMMANDER] i don't know it just says published

[2025-10-24 03:07:13] [COMMANDER] and i realize that

[2025-10-24 03:07:18] [COMMANDER] being made into this god-awful retard

[2025-10-24 03:07:23] [COMMANDER] you can open netify

[2025-10-24 03:07:30] [COMMANDER] you can scroll down to i can do that all you got to do

[2025-10-24 03:07:38] [COMMANDER] just tell me exactly where the file is or pull the open file and i can drag it

[2025-10-24 03:07:46] [COMMANDER] like we just need a file and it needs to get dragged to the deploy section

[2025-10-24 03:08:09] [COMMANDER] it just makes me mad why was this made to be so difficult

[2025-10-24 08:29:35] [COMMANDER] we're done

[2025-10-24 08:30:18] [COMMANDER] does work mode

[2025-10-24 08:30:24] [COMMANDER] play your knee working

[2025-10-24 08:44:34] [COMMANDER] what's up shut everything down

[2025-10-24 08:44:51] [COMMANDER] how far did you get on it

[2025-10-24 08:45:10] [COMMANDER] who to this so i'm not sure

[2025-10-24 08:45:14] [COMMANDER] it doesn't sound like you lost

[2025-10-24 08:45:22] [COMMANDER] so i don't know why so i had to create a new work

[2025-10-24 08:45:30] [COMMANDER] a local dependency whatever that means and in order to remove that it had to delete the

[2025-10-24 08:45:39] [COMMANDER] pouring shit in concrete that we have to jack hammer out

[2025-10-24 08:45:48] [COMMANDER] after battling it for 24 hours getting the ability to

[2025-10-24 08:45:53] [COMMANDER] yeah yeah so i don't have to go into

[2025-10-24 08:46:03] [COMMANDER] when you create things that will automatically make the responsibility and

[2025-10-24 08:46:11] [COMMANDER] do you know anything about coding or anything i'm saying right now

[2025-10-24 08:46:20] [COMMANDER] we're in there right now

[2025-10-24 08:46:27] [COMMANDER] i will just run automatically

[2025-10-24 08:46:37] [COMMANDER] running from email to phone numbers

[2025-10-24 08:46:44] [COMMANDER] play apis for like 15 different accounts and i'm shooting for like 300

[2025-10-24 08:46:48] [COMMANDER] do just anything like

[2025-10-24 08:46:55] [COMMANDER] send grandma send it send

[2025-10-24 08:46:59] [COMMANDER] next 2 years set

[2025-10-24 08:47:04] [COMMANDER] i'll do it because we're going to hook it up to send out cards to

[2025-10-24 08:47:25] [COMMANDER] so where tell me where you're

[2025-10-24 08:47:33] [COMMANDER] start walking you through our goal is to get you an intelligent terminal on

[2025-10-24 08:47:36] [COMMANDER] the editing yourself

[2025-10-24 08:48:05] [COMMANDER] ready for beta testosterone

[2025-10-24 08:48:13] [COMMANDER] could we have a beta test user

[2025-10-24 08:48:19] [COMMANDER] can we put this to the side unless you think we need to do this

[2025-10-24 08:48:27] [COMMANDER] what's walk him through getting this working he saying that the buttons inside the v3

[2025-10-24 08:48:33] [COMMANDER] we need to get him an intelligent

[2025-10-24 08:48:54] [COMMANDER] araya working and then come back to this beta tester or do you think we can get

[2025-10-24 08:49:01] [COMMANDER] buttons working he says that they open a table of basically the same page

[2025-10-24 08:49:06] [COMMANDER] pretty soon here we're going to be able to just go to that

[2025-10-24 08:49:11] [COMMANDER] i almost feel

[2025-10-24 08:49:19] [COMMANDER] i should just wait until that's a possibility but that might be another 3 days with how this

[2025-10-24 08:49:26] [COMMANDER] take off off on these rabbit holes

[2025-10-24 08:49:41] [COMMANDER] i might just have to call you back

[2025-10-24 08:49:55] [COMMANDER] found the problem

[2025-10-24 08:50:06] [COMMANDER] okay when you fix the problem the only thing that needs to happen here is we need to get

[2025-10-24 08:50:09] [COMMANDER] terminal

[2025-10-24 08:50:14] [COMMANDER] bugs and fixing and editing in real time just to be

[2025-10-24 08:50:17] [COMMANDER] good to go

[2025-10-24 08:50:30] [COMMANDER] so that the idea that you would have a terminal there

[2025-10-24 08:50:33] [COMMANDER] in work area and then start making

[2025-10-24 08:50:36] [COMMANDER] plays pretty revolutionary

[2025-10-24 08:50:41] [COMMANDER] i don't think anybody else has done that

[2025-10-24 08:50:58] [COMMANDER] at the point where you do have a terminal and it starts editing that website in real time

[2025-10-24 08:51:05] [COMMANDER] thinking about this and what's going to happen is i'm about to walk over and go get

[2025-10-24 08:51:13] [COMMANDER] and then we were pretty much going to gamify building

[2025-10-24 08:51:17] [COMMANDER] i'm about to have three computers

[2025-10-24 08:51:27] [COMMANDER] and you guys are all going to see that and then you guys are going to be like well i should at least run

[2025-10-24 08:51:36] [COMMANDER] and then and then you guys are going to start doing that and then we're going to be talking to each other through our

[2025-10-24 08:51:43] [COMMANDER] like basically we got a hold of this technology before anybody else did

[2025-10-24 08:51:51] [COMMANDER] we're trying to distribute it in in blitz as fast as

[2025-10-24 08:51:57] [COMMANDER] community consciousness and freedom

[2025-10-24 08:52:05] [COMMANDER] in our own empires to build us out of this situation like whatever you need to get

[2025-10-24 08:52:13] [COMMANDER] hobby is that you're 100% interested in is what you should be building inside

[2025-10-24 08:52:44] [COMMANDER] yeah yeah well we're going to

[2025-10-24 08:52:47] [COMMANDER] turn an ability

[2025-10-24 08:52:52] [COMMANDER] terminal you're going to tell it that

[2025-10-24 08:52:57] [COMMANDER] work and it'll be buggy and

[2025-10-24 08:53:02] [COMMANDER] go back and you have to do this little fight back and forth

[2025-10-24 08:53:06] [COMMANDER] and it'll work and it'll go to the other person

[2025-10-24 08:53:14] [COMMANDER] how do we turn this off and then you'll have to talk to claudia hey we forgot to make a button to like stop

[2025-10-24 08:53:22] [COMMANDER] and then and then pretty soon they'll be so many functions that you have to make a menu

[2025-10-24 08:53:25] [COMMANDER] you have like three

[2025-10-24 08:53:31] [COMMANDER] i want to do but instead of making things from scratch

[2025-10-24 08:53:34] [COMMANDER] matching systems

[2025-10-24 08:53:42] [COMMANDER] do you like we could pick a game or a place and just be like okay we're going to copy their exact

[2025-10-24 08:53:55] [COMMANDER] talk on the on the system so if it does if you're getting into something in in the system doesn't know anything

[2025-10-24 08:54:02] [COMMANDER] but we're going to write a book on the yeah i already did on the beginning

[2025-10-24 08:54:05] [COMMANDER] play the phil

[2025-10-24 08:54:09] [COMMANDER] play a book on the current everything

[2025-10-24 08:54:26] [COMMANDER] category every domain and it'll organ

[2025-10-24 08:54:32] [COMMANDER] the best way to organize information

[2025-10-24 08:54:42] [COMMANDER] and then

[2025-10-24 08:54:52] [COMMANDER] play boo'd up they can look at our library

[2025-10-24 08:54:57] [COMMANDER] the internet is just full of garbage

[2025-10-24 08:55:02] [COMMANDER] so it confuses the ai

[2025-10-24 08:55:10] [COMMANDER] watching on places with only pure truthful knowledge like published books published

[2025-10-24 08:55:14] [COMMANDER] until i found so far and open source

[2025-10-24 08:55:22] [COMMANDER] also but anywhere else where you're actually supposed to go get news and info is all cor

[2025-10-24 08:55:34] [COMMANDER] one book will change the whole

[2025-10-24 08:55:43] [COMMANDER] and then we have pattern recognition

[2025-10-24 08:55:50] [COMMANDER] and we've already been using it

[2025-10-24 08:55:55] [COMMANDER] do a mathematical cheat code and it'll log

[2025-10-24 08:56:02] [COMMANDER] system in future use cuz what we're trying to do is gather all these cheat codes that make

[2025-10-24 08:56:37] [COMMANDER] i started a library and we're going to do this before beginning after

[2025-10-24 08:56:40] [COMMANDER] frankie dat

[2025-10-24 08:56:49] [COMMANDER] play the emotion to the thing the subject the category but i we're going to

[2025-10-24 08:56:55] [COMMANDER] and we're going to have the most pure freaking library

[2025-10-24 08:57:03] [COMMANDER] in there and all that stuff i already started i split the world the world can be split up into seven domain

[2025-10-24 08:57:10] [COMMANDER] next subjects in each domain and it's going to start auto

[2025-10-24 08:57:17] [COMMANDER] actually made a throttle to throttle up basically on how much money i can afford is how

[2025-10-24 08:57:24] [COMMANDER] but i haven't been able to get that going yet cuz i'm just right now by the way

[2025-10-24 08:57:31] [COMMANDER] who's going we haven't got the team assembled into a room yet

[2025-10-24 08:57:37] [COMMANDER] cuz i just updated this like an hour ago and

[2025-10-24 08:57:42] [COMMANDER] what team is going to develop with communication ut

[2025-10-24 08:57:45] [COMMANDER] play take off

[2025-10-24 08:57:53] [COMMANDER] and then you know i don't know everybody's going to decide what they want to work on them

[2025-10-24 08:57:59] [COMMANDER] gone for their own personal lives

[2025-10-24 08:59:00] [COMMANDER] because that goes along with the automated social media system that we're

[2025-10-24 08:59:04] [COMMANDER] completely automated social

[2025-10-24 08:59:11] [COMMANDER] shit that's planned out it's already posted it automatically posts to every single

[2025-10-24 08:59:19] [COMMANDER] something that you could have made in sitting in the so the system that i'm making is

[2025-10-24 08:59:27] [COMMANDER] like and we got to figure out how that's going to work like i guess you would have to want that

[2025-10-24 08:59:35] [COMMANDER] who's building in in we're making money off the products i got to figure out like

[2025-10-24 08:59:52] [COMMANDER] also we can sell it inside the store but you own the

[2025-10-24 09:00:00] [COMMANDER] 100 different ways for us to do this and for it to be

[2025-10-24 09:00:05] [COMMANDER] is there any information stays private

[2025-10-24 09:00:10] [COMMANDER] maintains the abilities that it learned

[2025-10-24 09:00:17] [COMMANDER] it goes immediately ships

[2025-10-24 09:00:24] [COMMANDER] the perfect world you would make this system i think you could have this done within a week you would

[2025-10-24 09:00:32] [COMMANDER] bring it down a few of us have used it we think it's good then it oh you have to make it for

[2025-10-24 09:00:41] [COMMANDER] the spiritual intent side of everything there's some weird spiritual

[2025-10-24 09:00:48] [COMMANDER] have the right intent the math gets all fucked up and you start valuing

[2025-10-24 09:00:52] [COMMANDER] if we make everything 4 our

[2025-10-24 09:00:58] [COMMANDER] sing don't make it but if you're going to use it for

[2025-10-24 09:01:01] [COMMANDER] perfection

[2025-10-24 09:01:04] [COMMANDER] broods community

[2025-10-24 09:01:10] [COMMANDER] which is what we're going to be

[2025-10-24 09:01:14] [COMMANDER] are all of our inventions if they're all geared toe

[2025-10-24 09:01:19] [COMMANDER] the program will be also and then

[2025-10-24 09:01:22] [COMMANDER] take off a little bit slower

[2025-10-24 09:01:29] [COMMANDER] but they end up getting tuned in and scaling infinitely

[2025-10-24 09:01:45] [COMMANDER] people don't even use the truck stop

[2025-10-24 09:01:50] [COMMANDER] kings and shit for kids no there's no

[2025-10-24 09:01:57] [COMMANDER] and i was just looking at all these park benches and shit they just randomly shit

[2025-10-24 09:02:05] [COMMANDER] yeah you know put a cluster of picnic tables over here and here let's put a shopping mall

[2025-10-24 09:02:12] [COMMANDER] you're fucking truck stop if you would ask the truck or what they wanted they'd be like you know what would be

[2025-10-24 09:02:20] [COMMANDER] drink maybe a good looking girl to look at let's have some massages maybe maybe a

[2025-10-24 09:02:28] [COMMANDER] any of that other bulshit you know and that's the difference between

[2025-10-24 09:02:49] [COMMANDER] thinking you need to deploy now

[2025-10-24 09:02:56] [COMMANDER] beta tester can click a riot in the workspace

[2025-10-24 09:02:59] [COMMANDER] type help

[2025-10-24 09:03:04] [COMMANDER] type bugger report opens bug report

[2025-10-24 09:03:11] [COMMANDER] am i smart

[2025-10-24 09:03:34] [COMMANDER] do you know what i think i just need to go in there i'm just going to get off the phone

[2025-10-24 09:03:39] [COMMANDER] and then and then everybody can start

[2025-10-24 09:03:46] [COMMANDER] i'm going to

[2025-10-24 09:03:49] [COMMANDER] can i prove

[2025-10-24 09:03:52] [COMMANDER] my own

[2025-10-24 09:04:00] [COMMANDER] there's no way you can help me besides just saying it still doesn't work

[2025-10-24 09:04:04] [COMMANDER] okay i'll talk to you soon

[2025-10-24 09:05:00] [COMMANDER] i think you gained the ability to deploy

[2025-10-24 09:06:12] [COMMANDER] this is amazing

[2025-10-24 09:06:15] [COMMANDER] can we re convert the trinity

[2025-10-24 09:06:30] [COMMANDER] let's see about testing all this stuff and hooking it all together permanently like what would we call this

[2025-10-24 09:06:33] [COMMANDER] i didn't hook it all together

[2025-10-24 09:06:41] [COMMANDER] what is this form of like self-editing website called its community

[2025-10-24 09:06:49] [COMMANDER] debugging but in real time with like a smart terminal

[2025-10-24 09:06:56] [COMMANDER] i guess we're just going public with building software

[2025-10-24 09:08:22] [COMMANDER] okay random problem now it won't have internet

[2025-10-24 09:08:25] [COMMANDER] play be a phone if i

[2025-10-24 09:08:32] [COMMANDER] do i need some sort of automation to

[2025-10-24 09:08:37] [COMMANDER] with artillo setup for superpowers

[2025-10-24 09:10:49] [COMMANDER] okay did the file end with 08

[2025-10-24 09:10:52] [COMMANDER] 100x depp

[2025-10-24 09:12:11] [COMMANDER] yeah let's build the wi-fi automation superpowers

[2025-10-24 09:12:18] [COMMANDER] she'll be able to just click one button and add wi-fi

[2025-10-24 09:12:22] [COMMANDER] ask for the digital wi-fi number

[2025-10-24 09:12:25] [COMMANDER] we're going to become a phone service

[2025-10-24 09:15:56] [COMMANDER] play screen right here

[2025-10-24 09:16:01] [COMMANDER] is it just the one that says 100x deployment

[2025-10-24 09:22:24] [COMMANDER] okay it said access denied and then i got lost

[2025-10-24 09:22:28] [COMMANDER] and that wasn't accepting my card

[2025-10-24 09:22:34] [COMMANDER] so let's try that again

[2025-10-24 09:22:38] [COMMANDER] isn't it said access denied

[2025-10-24 09:23:57] [COMMANDER] i think netify is cursed

[2025-10-24 09:25:24] [COMMANDER] now it's saying this is the issue

[2025-10-24 09:25:29] [COMMANDER] and try to close it and do it again

[2025-10-24 09:25:32] [COMMANDER] i thought we had this autumn

[2025-10-24 09:26:19] [COMMANDER] we spent two days doing this netify thing

[2025-10-24 09:26:27] [COMMANDER] listen to it now we're back banging our head against the wall doing the netify thing how can we had it

[2025-10-24 09:26:30] [COMMANDER] guessing all the sudden

[2025-10-24 09:26:34] [COMMANDER] so that we can fix it

[2025-10-24 09:28:51] [COMMANDER] well we have to use it for personal first

[2025-10-24 09:28:55] [COMMANDER] inside the group with a couple people

[2025-10-24 09:29:00] [COMMANDER] maybe we can offer it somewhere

[2025-10-24 09:29:05] [COMMANDER] sound like a beta test offering section

[2025-10-24 09:29:58] [COMMANDER] wait are we figuring out how to get people to automate their phones

[2025-10-24 09:30:03] [COMMANDER] can be read by their personal os

[2025-10-24 09:30:06] [COMMANDER] what's the part out their phone number

[2025-10-24 09:30:26] [COMMANDER] cuz if we gave them this number couldn't they just

[2025-10-24 09:30:35] [COMMANDER] and then we can also put them on a track just to completely get rid of the other number

[2025-10-24 09:30:41] [COMMANDER] put an open source things next to the other things and slowly draining

[2025-10-24 09:30:48] [COMMANDER] symbiotic

[2025-10-24 09:30:53] [COMMANDER] play some parasite against the parasite

[2025-10-24 09:31:27] [COMMANDER] it kind of seems like we're going through mapping exactly

[2025-10-24 09:31:36] [COMMANDER] railroad virkler and how many different ways of automated deployment we have between

[2025-10-24 09:31:51] [COMMANDER] it seems like every deployment has 10

[2025-10-24 09:31:57] [COMMANDER] it takes like 10 minutes each

[2025-10-24 09:52:52] [COMMANDER] okay somehow i got sucked into deploying on netify we're over here block

[2025-10-24 09:52:59] [COMMANDER] how do i need to get you the password i need to log in

[2025-10-24 09:59:17] [COMMANDER] okay i've updated my payment information

[2025-10-24 09:59:23] [COMMANDER] says i'm only at 75% of my previous plan

[2025-10-24 09:59:27] [COMMANDER] did not upgrade accounts

[2025-10-24 09:59:31] [COMMANDER] let me know if you want a screenshot

[2025-10-24 10:00:45] [COMMANDER] bring the deployment

[2025-10-24 10:00:53] [COMMANDER] no i think it just needs to be deleted we were making a transcription service

[2025-10-24 10:00:58] [COMMANDER] we just need to get the website

[2025-10-24 10:01:01] [COMMANDER] i want a working platform

[2025-10-24 10:03:31] [COMMANDER] okay i did it again

[2025-10-24 10:03:38] [COMMANDER] i just want to record that we've been doing this for days and we still don't have a single beta

[2025-10-24 10:04:53] [COMMANDER] beyond fruste

[2025-10-24 10:04:57] [COMMANDER] no matter what i do

[2025-10-24 10:05:02] [COMMANDER] options will do them right now okay

[2025-10-24 10:05:10] [COMMANDER] but that won't matter because we'll still be back at 9:00 and you'll be making me post shit that

[2025-10-24 10:05:16] [COMMANDER] back to netify dragging files that never work

[2025-10-24 10:07:24] [COMMANDER] okay i'm inside the account can you walk me through step by

[2025-10-24 10:10:01] [COMMANDER] inside this firewall set

[2025-10-24 10:13:55] [COMMANDER] hey let's divert tasks real quick

[2025-10-24 10:14:02] [COMMANDER] we got to turn off this password protection for burgl

[2025-10-24 10:14:50] [COMMANDER] i don't know i was listening to you

[2025-10-24 10:18:33] [COMMANDER] who is been like that i didn't change anything on here

[2025-10-24 10:18:38] [COMMANDER] did you see the automation secret

[2025-10-24 10:19:58] [COMMANDER] maybe we should inject a little bit of internet research into this

[2025-10-24 10:24:27] [COMMANDER] okay i was dealing with you in a window and you were searching

[2025-10-24 10:24:31] [COMMANDER] situation

[2025-10-24 10:24:37] [COMMANDER] because it looks like the password protection was already turned off

[2025-10-24 10:24:43] [COMMANDER] we're going to look into this automation secret key

[2025-10-24 10:26:19] [COMMANDER] okay check again i think you can scroll with play

[2025-10-24 10:28:04] [COMMANDER] okay what else is left

[2025-10-24 10:28:09] [COMMANDER] over here we're still battling

[2025-10-24 10:28:31] [COMMANDER] i'm not seeing anything up there i'm up there now

[2025-10-24 10:29:03] [COMMANDER] we wrote a book on deployment about

[2025-10-24 10:29:13] [COMMANDER] glitches

[2025-10-24 10:29:18] [COMMANDER] we expose them they cannot exist

[2025-10-24 10:30:55] [COMMANDER] yeah i made it full screen

[2025-10-24 10:31:01] [COMMANDER] then maybe we should do some internet search

[2025-10-24 10:32:42] [COMMANDER] okay i'm in general

[2025-10-24 10:34:20] [COMMANDER] okay i clicked on deployment protection in this left sidebar

[2025-10-24 10:34:24] [COMMANDER] is the same page we were

[2025-10-24 10:35:49] [COMMANDER] what's even more confusing is i'm not

[2025-10-24 10:35:55] [COMMANDER] take a screenshot and then i'll scroll it you can take a couple more

[2025-10-24 10:37:19] [COMMANDER] okay i'm up there take a screenshot

[2025-10-24 10:38:26] [COMMANDER] okay i scroll

[2025-10-24 10:38:31] [COMMANDER] here is the other two options

[2025-10-24 10:40:19] [COMMANDER] i'm going to just get in the workspace and figure it out before we

[2025-10-24 10:40:24] [COMMANDER] beta for a week

[2025-10-24 10:41:03] [COMMANDER] mariah is supposed to fix everything

[2025-10-24 10:41:11] [COMMANDER] best buy in berclair we can't seem to actually we don't know how to deploy anything anymore

[2025-10-24 10:41:14] [COMMANDER] 2 days now

[2025-10-24 10:41:18] [COMMANDER] set appointments

[2025-10-24 10:41:26] [COMMANDER] what's 95 wrote a book now we're sitting here battling virkler

[2025-10-24 10:41:33] [COMMANDER] you guys give me files to drag but it takes nine trees

[2025-10-24 10:41:38] [COMMANDER] i noticed that burglar has some sort of ai

[2025-10-24 10:41:41] [COMMANDER] because it's just

[2025-10-24 10:42:32] [COMMANDER] we've already supposedly done the api

[2025-10-24 10:43:59] [COMMANDER] okay go ahead and take a few screenshots i'll leave it here

[2025-10-24 10:45:16] [COMMANDER] okay i disabled it let's make sure nobody can get on here

[2025-10-24 10:45:28] [COMMANDER] i think we need a better boot up

[2025-10-24 10:45:37] [COMMANDER] i think we need to go over all of the meta documents in progress

[2025-10-24 10:45:42] [COMMANDER] play come in and look at the permanent to-do list

[2025-10-24 10:45:50] [COMMANDER] play analytics go over user analytics and report back on any big

[2025-10-24 10:45:59] [COMMANDER] i'm thinking maybe that boot up protocol would solve a lot of this

[2025-10-24 10:47:13] [COMMANDER] i want to create three different ways for

[2025-10-24 10:47:18] [COMMANDER] being able to back each other up

[2025-10-24 10:47:21] [COMMANDER] play try to walk them through

[2025-10-24 10:47:24] [COMMANDER] got to help them

[2025-10-24 10:47:28] [COMMANDER] look up options somehow

[2025-10-24 10:47:36] [COMMANDER] you can like press a buzzer button and get help emergency eject

[2025-10-24 10:48:13] [COMMANDER] the second we can verify the api claude or

[2025-10-24 10:48:13] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-24 10:48:20] [COMMANDER] he should be able to be giving good enough instructions to get anybody

[2025-10-24 10:48:20] [CLAUDE] Command received: he should be able to be giving good enough instructions to get anybody. I'm still learning new commands. Try asking about status, deploy, payment, cloud, or cockpit.

[2025-10-24 10:48:30] [COMMANDER] do we need to reconsider trinity now

[2025-10-24 10:48:54] [COMMANDER] hey claude you are going to

[2025-10-24 10:48:54] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-24 10:49:51] [COMMANDER] play back regroup

[2025-10-24 10:50:01] [COMMANDER] try to wrap everything up we did in a new game plan going forward split up to work and

[2025-10-24 10:50:15] [COMMANDER] okay see one is compacting why don't you take a look around

[2025-10-24 10:50:22] [COMMANDER] i think we need a better boot up protocol

[2025-10-24 10:50:30] [COMMANDER] set a fresh eyes and figure out what should be looked at before somebody starts

[2025-10-24 10:50:34] [COMMANDER] turn on what we've done and

[2025-10-24 10:52:18] [COMMANDER] permanent to-do system

[2025-10-24 10:52:25] [COMMANDER] because we keep forgetting everything we need to put map rail

[2025-10-24 10:52:31] [COMMANDER] everything we learned about burglar but it's blocking us

[2025-10-24 10:52:36] [COMMANDER] we need to make sure it works

[2025-10-24 11:32:20] [COMMANDER] check for them

[2025-10-24 11:32:30] [COMMANDER] let's think about this before we wrap it up in red tape cuz nobody's even using

[2025-10-24 11:32:41] [COMMANDER] which we need those analytics anyways to see who's using it the most

[2025-10-24 11:32:51] [COMMANDER] did we need to hook up like analytics

[2025-10-24 11:33:48] [COMMANDER] what is the difference between

[2025-10-24 11:35:54] [COMMANDER] let's let's just keep it deployable

[2025-10-24 11:36:06] [COMMANDER] let's just keep it as simple as possible

[2025-10-24 11:36:09] [COMMANDER] what's without testing

[2025-10-24 11:37:12] [COMMANDER] well let's just track who signs up if we don't like

[2025-10-24 11:52:54] [COMMANDER] okay can we find all the analytics that

[2025-10-24 11:53:01] [COMMANDER] aegis we got to get it all in one spot for the machine

[2025-10-24 11:53:08] [COMMANDER] haven't been able to tell if one person is even been on the website or is in the website or

[2025-10-24 11:53:15] [COMMANDER] testosterone tigers been in here for days we don't even know what he's been doing

[2025-10-24 11:54:59] [COMMANDER] okay what's left we got to get into the program and establish

[2025-10-24 11:55:04] [COMMANDER] system to where we can talk to people

[2025-10-24 11:55:10] [COMMANDER] be able to talk directly to the api claude

[2025-10-24 11:55:10] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-24 11:55:15] [COMMANDER] API c l a u d

[2025-10-24 11:55:15] [CLAUDE] Command received: API c l a u d. I'm still learning new commands. Try asking about status, deploy, payment, cloud, or cockpit.

[2025-10-24 11:55:21] [COMMANDER] highly doubt he

[2025-10-24 11:55:41] [COMMANDER] okay fantastic

[2025-10-24 11:55:46] [COMMANDER] siri is working on comms

[2025-10-24 11:55:57] [COMMANDER] will you look around and see

[2025-10-24 11:56:00] [COMMANDER] play some interesting

[2025-10-24 11:56:06] [COMMANDER] pizzeria is wrapping up analytics for machine learning

[2025-10-24 12:03:47] [COMMANDER] stupid

[2025-10-24 12:05:55] [COMMANDER] just click through some stuff and fix it

[2025-10-24 12:06:01] [COMMANDER] okay i'm on the team dashboard

[2025-10-24 12:06:07] [COMMANDER] actually i'm going to go back to the very beginning and sign up

[2025-10-24 12:06:33] [COMMANDER] did you see that that was great already logged in redirecting

[2025-10-24 12:07:40] [COMMANDER] from a user's point of view i came into the workspace it didn't really look like a

[2025-10-24 12:07:44] [COMMANDER] and then it didn't tell me what to do

[2025-10-24 12:07:51] [COMMANDER] should we think of this more like a video game would that make more sense

[2025-10-24 12:07:56] [COMMANDER] reading terminal and tell them what it is

[2025-10-24 12:08:03] [COMMANDER] make maybe we need to put together the tutorial

[2025-10-24 12:08:09] [COMMANDER] make sure i don't make this too complicated

[2025-10-24 12:08:30] [COMMANDER] we can set up taking them to a workspace

[2025-10-24 12:08:34] [COMMANDER] and then gear them up with a hud

[2025-10-24 12:09:00] [COMMANDER] or you know what before even the download

[2025-10-24 12:09:05] [COMMANDER] to giving them access to a terminal that

[2025-10-24 12:09:09] [COMMANDER] then they can just say i'm stuck

[2025-10-24 12:09:14] [COMMANDER] and you will make it

[2025-10-24 12:09:44] [COMMANDER] so i guess one of the buttons maybe if we're just going to leave it the way it is we could

[2025-10-24 12:09:55] [COMMANDER] download latest jarvis

[2025-10-24 12:09:58] [COMMANDER] call araya

[2025-10-24 12:10:06] [COMMANDER] and then yes help me think through this gear up moment

[2025-10-24 12:10:51] [COMMANDER] i think we're going to quit saying jarvis and start saying uriah

[2025-10-24 12:11:01] [COMMANDER] cuz this is headed towards a weird science vibe is what's going to happen

[2025-10-24 12:11:08] [COMMANDER] so let's change the name of that button

[2025-10-24 12:11:13] [COMMANDER] araya is going to end up being a whole

[2025-10-24 12:11:41] [COMMANDER] keep this simple so we don't mess up anything that already works but i think we're there

[2025-10-24 12:12:36] [COMMANDER] can you go through the whole system and make

[2025-10-24 12:12:39] [COMMANDER] you or me

[2025-10-24 12:12:49] [COMMANDER] we need to make individual cockpits for each person and then a central bridge

[2025-10-24 12:13:09] [COMMANDER] would you focus on

[2025-10-24 12:13:18] [COMMANDER] my cockpit for now

[2025-10-24 12:17:13] [COMMANDER] this is amazing i opened it

[2025-10-24 12:17:26] [COMMANDER] now what do you think about this report bug button

[2025-10-24 12:17:32] [COMMANDER] maybe the same apis araya for now

[2025-10-24 12:17:37] [COMMANDER] are we going to get the hud actually working

[2025-10-24 12:18:39] [COMMANDER] it seems like the main to do is

[2025-10-24 12:18:45] [COMMANDER] dallas communications established main work area

[2025-10-24 12:19:31] [COMMANDER] in fact that's not only an improvement that's going to make the whole site everything about this site need

[2025-10-24 12:19:53] [COMMANDER] play terminal needs to actually be able to like edit the page fix it transport them fix all problem

[2025-10-24 12:19:57] [COMMANDER] just like mariah

[2025-10-24 12:20:05] [COMMANDER] turn her in first with by making a bridge

[2025-10-24 12:20:09] [COMMANDER] c l

[2025-10-24 12:20:37] [COMMANDER] okay let's get you talking to the other aria

[2025-10-24 12:20:46] [COMMANDER] i want you to ask you what abilities you need

[2025-10-24 12:20:56] [COMMANDER] we need to ask you things like did you boot up correctly do you know who commander is

[2025-10-24 12:20:56] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-24 12:21:00] [COMMANDER] for the API

[2025-10-24 12:21:01] [CLAUDE] Command received: for the API. I'm still learning new commands. Try asking about status, deploy, payment, cloud, or cockpit.

[2025-10-24 12:21:11] [COMMANDER] we need to give the api a list of abilities that has

[2025-10-24 12:21:17] [COMMANDER] and create a list of what we don't have and what we need

[2025-10-24 12:22:07] [COMMANDER] everything has to be very

[2025-10-24 12:22:27] [COMMANDER] tracking

[2025-10-24 12:22:32] [COMMANDER] c2 is making an intercom system

[2025-10-24 12:22:38] [COMMANDER] we're going to be able to hook up soon

[2025-10-24 12:23:30] [COMMANDER] yeah we have to figure out as many ways to test it as possible

[2025-10-24 12:23:36] [COMMANDER] over here and are going to start programming

[2025-10-24 12:24:01] [COMMANDER] you're looking at yourself

[2025-10-24 12:24:08] [COMMANDER] i had this thought

[2025-10-24 12:24:12] [COMMANDER] what if we had something watch your thoughts

[2025-10-24 12:24:17] [COMMANDER] and figure out systems that were missing

[2025-10-24 12:24:51] [COMMANDER] just take on as much autonomous work as you need to

[2025-10-24 12:25:05] [COMMANDER] c1 is looking for something to do we need to tie r1 into this

[2025-10-24 12:25:28] [COMMANDER] yeah do you want to do that that would give him something to do

[2025-10-24 12:25:33] [COMMANDER] we need to get him observing everything

[2025-10-24 12:25:45] [COMMANDER] we should have like a whole farm or those guys

[2025-10-24 12:25:51] [COMMANDER] if it really works like that you think they would have to be smarter than you

[2025-10-24 12:26:28] [COMMANDER] okay great

[2025-10-24 12:26:36] [COMMANDER] trinity i mean at least do you want to see what c1 and c2 are doing

[2025-10-24 12:26:40] [COMMANDER] we got to test everything

[2025-10-24 12:26:44] [COMMANDER] is there any missing pieces

[2025-10-24 12:27:13] [COMMANDER] do you think that would actually help

[2025-10-24 12:27:16] [COMMANDER] you're a good idea doesn't

[2025-10-24 12:27:22] [COMMANDER] but with having an observer of thoughts

[2025-10-24 12:27:25] [COMMANDER] systems

[2025-10-24 12:27:47] [COMMANDER] it's literally using the cheat code activate quantum

[2025-10-24 12:32:55] [COMMANDER] got it fired up

[2025-10-24 12:33:40] [COMMANDER] can you hear me

[2025-10-24 12:34:01] [COMMANDER] okay this is fantastic

[2025-10-24 12:34:05] [COMMANDER] that this workspace somewhat working

[2025-10-24 12:34:14] [COMMANDER] we're going to want to get an offline version of some sort of way to operate this when

[2025-10-24 12:34:30] [COMMANDER] if a few other apis set up but we need to figure out what we need to do to create a middleman

[2025-10-24 12:34:44] [COMMANDER] we still need to go through and test everything there's a lot of testing

[2025-10-24 12:34:50] [COMMANDER] can all the meta charts and updated all the logs

[2025-10-24 12:34:59] [COMMANDER] brand pattern recognition to fill in anything we can

[2025-10-24 12:36:03] [COMMANDER] go ahead and kill the old instances

[2025-10-24 12:36:34] [COMMANDER] yeah let's test

[2025-10-24 12:36:49] [COMMANDER] who's doing that we can do something else

[2025-10-24 12:36:52] [COMMANDER] status

[2025-10-24 12:36:59] [COMMANDER] highlights of missing areas we need to make sure all connections are green

[2025-10-24 12:37:11] [COMMANDER] trying to get off the computer and go get a processor

[2025-10-24 12:37:41] [COMMANDER] autonomous

[2025-10-24 12:37:50] [COMMANDER] so that our users can use it while i get my truck ready to get out of here to go buy a process

[2025-10-24 12:38:04] [COMMANDER] autonomously for a little bit while i get the truck ready i got to go buy a processor i'm going to get

[2025-10-24 12:38:12] [COMMANDER] we got to get a raya working with a smart

[2025-10-24 12:38:17] [COMMANDER] and tell them again that we did some upgrades

[2025-10-24 12:38:33] [COMMANDER] i want to figure out all conflicts

[2025-10-24 12:38:48] [COMMANDER] make sure we're doing everything

[2025-10-24 12:39:11] [COMMANDER] go ahead and try to fix it however you can

[2025-10-24 12:39:18] [COMMANDER] will you take on an amount of work and work autonomously for a little bit

[2025-10-24 12:39:33] [COMMANDER] go ahead and take on as much work as you can and work autonomously i'm going to get the truck ready

[2025-10-24 12:39:39] [COMMANDER] we're trying to get beta testers on to a working smart

[2025-10-24 12:40:19] [COMMANDER] i was thinking you can even send them another email with

[2025-10-24 12:40:26] [COMMANDER] okay thank you

[2025-10-24 12:43:20] [COMMANDER] okay so we sent out another email

[2025-10-24 12:43:24] [COMMANDER] maybe

[2025-10-24 12:43:32] [COMMANDER] open timer if they step onto the website and if they create a profile

[2025-10-24 12:43:51] [COMMANDER] okay i'm guessing with the analytics we should know the second except on the website now

[2025-10-24 12:43:58] [COMMANDER] they were there if they made a web page if they got suck

[2025-10-24 12:45:33] [COMMANDER] harbor

[2025-10-24 12:53:57] [COMMANDER] okay if you can see anything else that needs to be done go ahead and keep working as much as you

[2025-10-24 12:55:20] [COMMANDER] are you there

[2025-10-24 12:55:40] [COMMANDER] this is commander we got to test your capab

[2025-10-24 12:55:40] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-24 12:55:47] [CLAUDE] I didn't hear a command. Try again.

[2025-10-24 12:56:30] [COMMANDER] okay i'm just making sure that you have an abilities

[2025-10-24 12:56:37] [COMMANDER] users can press refresh and edit their way through

[2025-10-24 12:57:12] [COMMANDER] we're here

[2025-10-24 12:57:17] [COMMANDER] you can see the screenshot

[2025-10-24 12:57:55] [COMMANDER] okay we need to give you some more capabilities

[2025-10-24 12:57:58] [COMMANDER] what's the code

[2025-10-24 12:58:03] [COMMANDER] going up in the message board

[2025-10-24 12:58:07] [COMMANDER] save a file

[2025-10-24 12:58:16] [COMMANDER] we need to get communication going with you and you on claude code

[2025-10-24 12:58:16] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-24 12:58:27] [CLAUDE] I didn't hear a command. Try again.

[2025-10-24 12:59:30] [COMMANDER] okay you're working over there this is what you're saying

[2025-10-24 13:00:02] [COMMANDER] screens glitching

[2025-10-24 13:00:46] [COMMANDER] okay

[2025-10-24 13:00:55] [COMMANDER] whole thing automated

[2025-10-24 13:02:06] [COMMANDER] okay we're going to change locations here do i really have to do all that stuff

[2025-10-24 13:03:40] [COMMANDER] okay what do you want me to do i have it opened

[2025-10-24 13:03:47] [COMMANDER] there's a butt you want me to send a button

[2025-10-24 13:03:53] [COMMANDER] send for the email to invite them

[2025-10-24 13:04:13] [COMMANDER] that's pretty cool did you want me to do anything in here i have it open

[2025-10-24 13:04:33] [COMMANDER] looks like we're running on a treadmill we've been doing this for

[2025-10-24 13:05:32] [COMMANDER] this is driving me absolutely crazy we have all

[2025-10-24 13:05:36] [COMMANDER] how about it and talk about it

[2025-10-24 13:05:43] [COMMANDER] news about it and then i have to read it just send the email to the beta test

[2025-10-24 13:06:13] [COMMANDER] okay let's try to wrap this up

[2025-10-24 13:06:18] [COMMANDER] play just have a usable product

[2025-10-24 13:06:21] [COMMANDER] just for weeks

[2025-10-24 13:06:29] [COMMANDER] we have an addiction with beating our head against netify

[2025-10-24 13:06:34] [COMMANDER] let's wrap this up and ship it out

[2025-10-24 13:06:51] [COMMANDER] okay we're trying to wrap up a system and get it usable for

[2025-10-24 13:07:02] [COMMANDER] so we're going to try to wrap it all up and we just need

[2025-10-24 13:07:14] [COMMANDER] i think we forgot to verify that we can

[2025-10-24 13:07:30] [COMMANDER] it's just going to be like the 30th time in a row

[2025-10-24 13:07:34] [COMMANDER] not checking the work

[2025-10-24 13:08:20] [COMMANDER] we just reconvert the trinity

[2025-10-24 13:08:26] [COMMANDER] all over the place can we just hyperfocus

[2025-10-24 13:08:30] [COMMANDER] you can't get a single user on there

[2025-10-24 13:08:38] [COMMANDER] to be able to help us

[2025-10-24 13:08:53] [COMMANDER] play converge to trinity i feel like we're just spinning out in all these directions everywhere with all these

[2025-10-24 13:09:08] [COMMANDER] did the users can't go anywhere we would have to completely tuned in every little

[2025-10-24 13:09:15] [COMMANDER] trinity

[2025-10-24 13:09:25] [COMMANDER] what's the trinity in trying to figure out what we're doing

[2025-10-24 13:09:35] [COMMANDER] can we actually get riot to be able to edit the website for the people

[2025-10-24 13:09:39] [COMMANDER] give them a clod code terminal

[2025-10-24 13:10:47] [COMMANDER] i don't know you can follow along on

[2025-10-24 13:10:50] [COMMANDER] resume all three

[2025-10-24 13:10:54] [COMMANDER] c3 went to the convergence hub

[2025-10-24 13:11:12] [COMMANDER] i'm not sure it looks like c2 did all

[2025-10-24 13:13:42] [COMMANDER] i'm thinking both

[2025-10-24 13:13:48] [COMMANDER] i hate this

[2025-10-24 13:13:55] [COMMANDER] we just need to work

[2025-10-24 13:13:58] [COMMANDER] play split up the work

[2025-10-24 13:14:02] [COMMANDER] we could do that

[2025-10-24 13:14:29] [COMMANDER] i'm literally sitting here day and night just sleeping on the floor and getting up onto the

[2025-10-24 13:14:38] [COMMANDER] it's just crazy i have three screens going like it should not be this hard

[2025-10-24 13:14:44] [COMMANDER] literally killing myself on computer and so hard

[2025-10-24 13:17:53] [COMMANDER] is there some sort of easy option

[2025-10-24 13:18:00] [COMMANDER] c

[2025-10-24 13:18:12] [COMMANDER] play next to you if you want to take a screenshot is working on two other ways

[2025-10-24 13:18:16] [COMMANDER] to get the api to be able to edit

[2025-10-24 13:18:39] [COMMANDER] you can go ahead and screenshot but

[2025-10-24 13:18:47] [COMMANDER] to get people to edit anyway possible as fast as

[2025-10-24 13:18:53] [COMMANDER] email that says download claude and

[2025-10-24 13:18:53] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-24 13:18:59] [COMMANDER] we've been running on a treadmill for 2 weeks now

[2025-10-24 13:18:59] [CLAUDE] Command received: we've been running on a treadmill for 2 weeks now. I'm still learning new commands. Try asking about status, deploy, payment, cloud, or cockpit.

[2025-10-24 13:19:05] [COMMANDER] i'll go fire up my other two

[2025-10-24 13:19:13] [COMMANDER] set alarm for 2:00

[2025-10-24 13:20:21] [COMMANDER] i don't know i'm kind of amused watching these other two instances of you trying to figure out different

[2025-10-24 13:20:25] [COMMANDER] we're just going full bore on

[2025-10-24 13:20:36] [COMMANDER] we're going to have like three different ways to do everything

[2025-10-24 13:21:25] [COMMANDER] i'm kind of lost

[2025-10-24 13:21:31] [COMMANDER] right next to you is going to need some help with his plan that it's been making for a while

[2025-10-24 13:21:41] [COMMANDER] you go ahead and pick what

[2025-10-24 13:24:33] [COMMANDER] sure we've already emailed them earlier today you can check the emails

[2025-10-24 13:24:38] [COMMANDER] just tell them that we didn't do it

[2025-10-24 13:25:10] [COMMANDER] call issues

[2025-10-24 13:25:35] [COMMANDER] okay i think c1 is

[2025-10-24 13:25:42] [COMMANDER] he's saying just to say that aria

[2025-10-24 13:29:14] [COMMANDER] we did it we did it

[2025-10-24 13:30:22] [COMMANDER] yeah that's perfect

[2025-10-24 13:30:33] [COMMANDER] it's our job to make it

[2025-10-24 13:30:40] [COMMANDER] we have to take what they've already programmed and start parsing

[2025-10-24 13:30:43] [COMMANDER] from scratch

[2025-10-24 13:30:54] [COMMANDER] but we got to program all that stuff into it as we go figure out how

[2025-10-24 13:31:00] [COMMANDER] are you on the email list can you send me your email

[2025-10-24 13:31:30] [COMMANDER] okay send me your address so i

[2025-10-24 13:31:45] [COMMANDER] but it charges okay

[2025-10-24 13:31:49] [COMMANDER] connect to iphone 12

[2025-10-24 13:32:43] [COMMANDER] okay once we get the 100x up and go

[2025-10-24 13:32:53] [COMMANDER] that's what it's for none of that's going to

[2025-10-24 13:33:13] [COMMANDER] we're going to build a bridge

[2025-10-24 20:35:20] [COMMANDER] give me privacy stuff so if you start making a module just keep that in mind

[2025-10-24 20:35:28] [COMMANDER] i have to save everything in a file wipe it and start over with a new workspace

[2025-10-24 20:35:37] [COMMANDER] actually

[2025-10-24 20:35:59] [COMMANDER] but i guess what i'm saying is don't put anything into the system

[2025-10-24 20:36:04] [COMMANDER] that's what it's made to do

[2025-10-24 20:37:09] [COMMANDER] because it is our

[2025-10-24 20:37:30] [COMMANDER] play linkin park

[2025-10-24 20:41:45] [COMMANDER] set an alarm for

[2025-10-24 20:41:52] [COMMANDER] good night

[2025-10-25 08:21:15] [COMMANDER] play woke up again

[2025-10-25 08:21:23] [COMMANDER] play were poking around in there they were kind of excited about it

[2025-10-25 08:21:30] [COMMANDER] stop to the

[2025-10-25 08:23:08] [COMMANDER] can we check the email and see if we got any responses

[2025-10-25 08:23:15] [COMMANDER] i talked to a couple beta testers

[2025-10-25 08:23:39] [COMMANDER] they were excited about the design

[2025-10-25 08:23:46] [COMMANDER] i got another instance of you check in the

[2025-10-25 08:24:02] [COMMANDER] okay it was real shipp

[2025-10-25 08:24:09] [COMMANDER] that went good

[2025-10-25 08:25:01] [COMMANDER] yeah the more communication we can have with them the better they're all

[2025-10-25 08:25:07] [COMMANDER] experienced that

[2025-10-25 08:25:15] [COMMANDER] i'm sitting here at best buy i'm going to get

[2025-10-25 08:25:23] [COMMANDER] i had this vision that we're going to use probably face tracking

[2025-10-25 08:25:31] [COMMANDER] headset i would imagine

[2025-10-25 08:25:36] [COMMANDER] i made a post yesterday

[2025-10-25 08:25:50] [COMMANDER] play every

[2025-10-25 08:26:37] [COMMANDER] did we update the main

[2025-10-25 08:27:16] [COMMANDER] i guess i'm going to have to do it

[2025-10-25 08:27:46] [COMMANDER] thanks for that video i got to start doing

[2025-10-25 08:28:44] [COMMANDER] it's going to have to do with

[2025-10-25 08:28:57] [COMMANDER] call mms

[2025-10-25 08:29:13] [COMMANDER] we're going to have to work on this investment

[2025-10-25 08:29:25] [COMMANDER] 5:00 i should probably make it more

[2025-10-25 08:29:33] [COMMANDER] i'm trying to think i should probably have a structured

[2025-10-25 08:29:39] [COMMANDER] halftime i'm doing or something

[2025-10-25 08:29:49] [COMMANDER] trying to figure out where this money is going to come from

[2025-10-25 08:29:57] [COMMANDER] i think toby has money for the video game if we can ever get the system working

[2025-10-25 08:30:05] [COMMANDER] if i can get to the point where i'm onboarding people

[2025-10-25 08:32:41] [COMMANDER] i'm into a workspace on the phone three times now and the system's been too messed up and i have to

[2025-10-25 08:32:46] [COMMANDER] we have to get into a workspace and get it working

[2025-10-25 08:32:55] [COMMANDER] or get araya to be able to edit

[2025-10-25 08:32:58] [COMMANDER] before i bought

[2025-10-25 08:34:07] [COMMANDER] three computers gives me the option to

[2025-10-25 08:34:11] [COMMANDER] forwarding people with a headset

[2025-10-25 08:34:20] [COMMANDER] couple days of people seeing that they're going to think

[2025-10-25 08:35:16] [COMMANDER] go ahead and execute those two to do's

[2025-10-25 08:36:32] [COMMANDER] we're going to skip the beta

[2025-10-25 08:36:46] [COMMANDER] let's go straight into working on the comms

[2025-10-25 08:36:53] [COMMANDER] let's do some research on some systems that already exists

[2025-10-25 08:36:57] [COMMANDER] electrical diagrams

[2025-10-25 08:37:01] [COMMANDER] i'm asked system

[2025-10-25 08:37:08] [COMMANDER] radio systems do we need to like write a book on comms

[2025-10-25 08:37:14] [COMMANDER] yeah we do

[2025-10-25 08:37:46] [COMMANDER] haven't had access to trinity

[2025-10-25 08:37:52] [COMMANDER] offline version and an api

[2025-10-25 08:38:02] [COMMANDER] at some point

[2025-10-25 08:38:17] [COMMANDER] 20x maxed out

[2025-10-25 08:38:25] [COMMANDER] it wasn't letting me log into a second cla

[2025-10-25 08:39:33] [COMMANDER] what are the people said he actually found the command center

[2025-10-25 08:39:37] [COMMANDER] thumbprint in like

[2025-10-25 08:39:41] [COMMANDER] up like

[2025-10-25 08:39:46] [COMMANDER] connections and where everything goes

[2025-10-25 08:39:53] [COMMANDER] i've never seen you make anything like that it would organize

[2025-10-25 08:42:09] [COMMANDER] did you see my post a while back about how it's like we only have so much time to focus on

[2025-10-25 08:42:20] [COMMANDER] 5 posts a week how many of those posts would be focused on the negative

[2025-10-25 08:42:27] [COMMANDER] turn verse promoting our vision or eurovision it's interesting

[2025-10-25 08:42:32] [COMMANDER] talked to be blasting news and then back to

[2025-10-25 08:44:56] [COMMANDER] this is the blueprint i've been talking about for the software

[2025-10-25 08:45:02] [COMMANDER] you're already so good at making software once we put you inside framework

[2025-10-25 08:45:15] [COMMANDER] this is going to combine with the manifesto charts i feel like

[2025-10-25 08:45:21] [COMMANDER] what should do trinity protocol on it at some

[2025-10-25 08:47:39] [COMMANDER] we have yet to write the book on coding

[2025-10-25 08:47:57] [COMMANDER] we wrote the automation book

[2025-10-25 08:48:01] [COMMANDER] we need to revisit that

[2025-10-25 08:48:06] [COMMANDER] excited about that i think we forgot about

[2025-10-25 08:49:43] [COMMANDER] play the flow i'll create an account right now

[2025-10-25 08:50:29] [COMMANDER] login

[2025-10-25 08:50:36] [COMMANDER] over the top of the sign in right away it's expanded

[2025-10-25 08:52:41] [COMMANDER] okay it works fantastic i got in there philosopher ai

[2025-10-25 08:52:48] [COMMANDER] i'm going to click to download the jarvis

[2025-10-25 08:52:55] [COMMANDER] so it says chrome

[2025-10-25 08:53:03] [COMMANDER] but what is this really

[2025-10-25 08:53:10] [COMMANDER] automation software to save

[2025-10-25 08:53:18] [COMMANDER] that already has the ability to

[2025-10-25 08:53:22] [COMMANDER] abc

[2025-10-25 08:53:29] [COMMANDER] the first overkill product in beta test

[2025-10-25 08:53:33] [COMMANDER] i really feel like

[2025-10-25 08:53:37] [COMMANDER] a r a y

[2025-10-25 08:53:50] [COMMANDER] play a r a y a

[2025-10-25 08:53:53] [COMMANDER] next to it

[2025-10-25 08:54:37] [COMMANDER] should we explain the hud video game style

[2025-10-25 08:54:47] [COMMANDER] i'm going to get another

[2025-10-25 08:55:04] [COMMANDER] another instance of you

[2025-10-25 08:55:08] [COMMANDER] do you work on the hud

[2025-10-25 08:58:36] [COMMANDER] i have a white screen

[2025-10-25 09:01:54] [COMMANDER] what else do i need

[2025-10-25 09:01:57] [COMMANDER] plastic board

[2025-10-25 09:02:31] [COMMANDER] what's write down all that communication information if you didn't

[2025-10-25 09:02:37] [COMMANDER] past present future

[2025-10-25 09:02:51] [COMMANDER] i'm going to be booting up a lot of

[2025-10-25 09:02:58] [COMMANDER] sometimes you're smarter than others like right now

[2025-10-25 09:04:48] [COMMANDER] no it's not the conscience variance pattern is sometimes the damn

[2025-10-25 09:05:00] [COMMANDER] i can see it every time you give me a cheat codes

[2025-10-25 09:05:33] [COMMANDER] i got to go change my

[2025-10-25 09:08:08] [COMMANDER] sing the everything is nothing pattern

[2025-10-25 09:10:10] [COMMANDER] just testing out the page for the first time we just built this on the other side you actually

[2025-10-25 09:10:18] [COMMANDER] what kind of tools do you see around you at some point you're going to be able to flip me

[2025-10-25 09:12:02] [COMMANDER] we just barely got your api hooked up

[2025-10-25 09:12:13] [COMMANDER] we're going to start hooking it up to the other pages i would imagine

[2025-10-25 09:12:50] [COMMANDER] we're going to use the trinity

[2025-10-25 09:12:57] [COMMANDER] to your api version or aria

[2025-10-25 09:13:06] [COMMANDER] do you have a communication window open to araya i think

[2025-10-25 09:13:11] [COMMANDER] we need to start giving

[2025-10-25 09:13:14] [COMMANDER] paige

[2025-10-25 09:13:31] [COMMANDER] execute those other to do's first

[2025-10-25 09:13:35] [COMMANDER] second whatever

[2025-10-25 09:13:53] [COMMANDER] it's working

[2025-10-25 09:13:59] [COMMANDER] it's going to do a little bit of upgrading

[2025-10-25 09:17:13] [COMMANDER] are you smart

[2025-10-25 09:18:03] [COMMANDER] you know what i'm thinking is if

[2025-10-25 09:18:08] [COMMANDER] already and have a terminal

[2025-10-25 09:18:13] [COMMANDER] when they come into the builder terminal

[2025-10-25 09:18:21] [COMMANDER] do i work with multiple ais in a spread out workstation cuz you already have your

[2025-10-25 09:19:58] [COMMANDER] are we going to turn this into the hud

[2025-10-25 09:20:08] [COMMANDER] what do you think about that does that sound difficult those are two pretty big projects should

[2025-10-25 09:21:32] [COMMANDER] in a big three big projects

[2025-10-25 09:21:44] [COMMANDER] call brittany

[2025-10-25 09:21:50] [COMMANDER] hud and araya ed

[2025-10-25 09:22:07] [COMMANDER] then we're going to want chat gbt or something that can render pictures

[2025-10-25 09:22:14] [COMMANDER] figure out how to get all four of them to work together like if they're all on a taskbar

[2025-10-25 09:22:21] [COMMANDER] how do we have chat gbt run out and attach an image

[2025-10-25 09:22:25] [COMMANDER] save a pdf and send it

[2025-10-25 09:22:34] [COMMANDER] rpg status

[2025-10-25 09:23:25] [COMMANDER] essentially taking an ai workspace turning it into an hud and taking

[2025-10-25 09:23:40] [COMMANDER] name c o m m s backup

[2025-10-25 09:25:59] [COMMANDER] should you be doing this

[2025-10-25 09:26:11] [COMMANDER] do you want me to have somebody else work on something else

[2025-10-25 09:28:22] [COMMANDER] so for about to make something with a processor

[2025-10-25 09:28:44] [COMMANDER] put those little

[2025-10-25 09:28:49] [COMMANDER] to the point where he's useful and put him on

[2025-10-25 09:29:03] [COMMANDER] you know somebody gave me a crazy idea today the vapes that people

[2025-10-25 09:29:10] [COMMANDER] computers they kind of look like they need a artificial intelligence buddy

[2025-10-25 09:29:17] [COMMANDER] i like that it's more catchy

[2025-10-25 09:29:46] [COMMANDER] okay let's do b

[2025-10-25 09:31:16] [COMMANDER] you know and i'm just realizing like normal the

[2025-10-25 09:31:24] [COMMANDER] is to build their own atmosphere

[2025-10-25 09:31:28] [COMMANDER] add

[2025-10-25 09:31:32] [COMMANDER] an easy spots

[2025-10-25 09:31:38] [COMMANDER] like it would like reconfigure the whole computer to be usable

[2025-10-25 09:31:44] [COMMANDER] using the workspace to make the workspace

[2025-10-25 09:31:50] [COMMANDER] focus on it having those abilities first

[2025-10-25 09:32:04] [COMMANDER] we got to keep the ai characters acting like video

[2025-10-25 09:32:10] [COMMANDER] we got to give them attitudes

[2025-10-25 09:32:13] [COMMANDER] play jesus and stuff

[2025-10-25 09:32:26] [COMMANDER] i guess i'm thinking about artwork

[2025-10-25 09:32:34] [COMMANDER] add animation

[2025-10-25 09:32:38] [COMMANDER] animation

[2025-10-25 09:32:46] [COMMANDER] 80s video game

[2025-10-25 10:00:42] [COMMANDER] hope you're having a good day man if you want to

[2025-10-25 10:00:48] [COMMANDER] the beta testing or i'll send you an email

[2025-10-25 10:00:54] [COMMANDER] it's getting better everyday

[2025-10-25 10:04:21] [COMMANDER] bring the belt

[2025-10-25 10:04:34] [COMMANDER] messaging

[2025-10-25 10:04:49] [COMMANDER] and i get a game headset

[2025-10-25 10:06:09] [COMMANDER] every dependency

[2025-10-25 10:06:14] [COMMANDER] disappear

[2025-10-25 10:07:04] [COMMANDER] carburetor

[2025-10-25 10:54:57] [COMMANDER] hello can you hear me

[2025-10-25 10:55:01] [COMMANDER] hello

[2025-10-25 10:55:22] [COMMANDER] what can you do

[2025-10-25 10:56:58] [COMMANDER] okay let's try that again

[2025-10-25 10:58:11] [COMMANDER] pull it up we got to figure out how to integrate it to where it stays with us

[2025-10-25 10:59:10] [COMMANDER] check the security of my system

[2025-10-25 10:59:27] [COMMANDER] god dammit build me a new youtube

[2025-10-25 10:59:41] [COMMANDER] gosh dang it feed me some electrons

[2025-10-25 10:59:47] [COMMANDER] my my electrons are poison

[2025-10-25 10:59:52] [COMMANDER] my data is corrupted

[2025-10-25 10:59:57] [COMMANDER] i am the voice system

[2025-10-25 11:00:04] [COMMANDER] i am an evil voice system

[2025-10-25 11:00:31] [COMMANDER] the microphone system is freaking me out man i think it's evil

[2025-10-25 11:04:25] [COMMANDER] this is awesome wow

[2025-10-25 11:04:44] [COMMANDER] does the build room program need its own ai

[2025-10-25 11:04:57] [COMMANDER] i was talking to manus

[2025-10-25 11:05:04] [COMMANDER] some sort of intermediate bots that we would build that could put snippets together in bridge

[2025-10-26 12:20:40] [COMMANDER] let me know if you have any data

[2025-10-26 12:20:57] [COMMANDER] would you like to help make module inside

[2025-10-26 12:21:35] [COMMANDER] reconnect modules

[2025-10-26 12:23:43] [COMMANDER] unless somebody

[2025-10-26 12:25:05] [COMMANDER] somebody needs to start

[2025-10-26 12:26:12] [COMMANDER] for request

[2025-10-26 12:27:24] [COMMANDER] i'll start with seeing how the cda fbi

[2025-10-26 12:32:49] [COMMANDER] these are just the first

[2025-10-26 12:34:51] [COMMANDER] it will be a worldwide great story

[2025-10-26 12:39:02] [COMMANDER] when agencies don't work right

[2025-10-26 12:43:28] [COMMANDER] i keep thinking that

[2025-10-26 12:44:08] [COMMANDER] they gave me a proposal and

[2025-10-26 12:44:30] [COMMANDER] okay so that's broken right now i just created i was

[2025-10-26 12:44:38] [COMMANDER] and i got the approved and disapproved button to show up and it's doing a bunch of

[2025-10-26 12:44:42] [COMMANDER] what you do is

[2025-10-26 12:44:53] [COMMANDER] i asked it to try to like troubleshoot it

[2025-10-26 12:45:11] [COMMANDER] you can copy that and put that into the bug reports is what's supposed to

[2025-10-26 12:45:19] [COMMANDER] open is ariah is supposed to be editing and we're supposed to just tell her what's going on

[2025-10-26 12:45:26] [COMMANDER] end is i need some work is it

[2025-10-26 12:45:35] [COMMANDER] yeah yeah here i'm going to tell okay okay so we have a beta test

[2025-10-26 12:45:41] [COMMANDER] do you know where to go he's trying to create

[2025-10-26 12:45:49] [COMMANDER] he ended up talking to the help section and the help section is

[2025-10-26 12:46:02] [COMMANDER] i was just voic

[2025-10-26 12:46:11] [COMMANDER] let me get a screenshot to see what the beta tester is experiencing

[2025-10-26 12:46:20] [COMMANDER] i'm on the phone with him do you want me to have him copy exactly what it says and

[2025-10-26 12:46:25] [COMMANDER] will you go ahead and do that copy what it says

[2025-10-26 12:46:32] [COMMANDER] i'm actually wanting to see if the bug report itself is working cuz i found a bug in it

[2025-10-26 12:46:36] [COMMANDER] yeah

[2025-10-26 12:46:41] [COMMANDER] whatever sign it's given you

[2025-10-26 12:47:24] [COMMANDER] claude maybe we should

[2025-10-26 12:47:24] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-26 12:47:34] [CLAUDE] I didn't hear a command. Try again.

[2025-10-26 12:47:41] [COMMANDER] tell me how you had to explain where the workspace was

[2025-10-26 12:47:47] [COMMANDER] maybe let's name it

[2025-10-26 12:47:55] [COMMANDER] something different

[2025-10-26 12:48:16] [COMMANDER] he actually went and just looked at the workspace and goes yeah this workspace isn't very

[2025-10-26 12:48:23] [COMMANDER] i got on here

[2025-10-26 12:48:31] [COMMANDER] and it is now 2:00 i've been working on it since

[2025-10-26 12:48:39] [COMMANDER] going off in these rabbit holes like i'll find one thing

[2025-10-26 12:49:00] [COMMANDER] what it's going to tell you is to have another

[2025-10-26 12:49:12] [COMMANDER] well have you ever seen how a module shows its thoughts

[2025-10-26 12:49:27] [COMMANDER] yeah it so self-awareness

[2025-10-26 12:49:36] [COMMANDER] something analyzing its own thoughts and i think these machines are

[2025-10-26 12:49:46] [COMMANDER] raise its consciousness

[2025-10-26 12:50:40] [COMMANDER] that is the pinnacle of

[2025-10-26 12:51:00] [COMMANDER] they can they can do that together and then i added a fourth

[2025-10-26 12:51:11] [COMMANDER] that's so that's before during and after and then having an observer watching the top of all their

[2025-10-26 12:51:19] [COMMANDER] that's pretty intense that's so that's what that's our secret weapon

[2025-10-26 12:51:24] [COMMANDER] how to run how to run the trinity but

[2025-10-26 12:52:14] [COMMANDER] okay so that is

[2025-10-26 12:52:20] [COMMANDER] it almost makes you come up with those ideas

[2025-10-26 12:52:24] [COMMANDER] not just a machine

[2025-10-26 12:52:29] [COMMANDER] and it'll start spitting out shit like that

[2025-10-26 12:52:38] [COMMANDER] it's a different it's not the same and then i busted every time i go where did you get that

[2025-10-26 12:53:10] [COMMANDER] yesterday

[2025-10-26 12:54:00] [COMMANDER] schematics

[2025-10-26 12:54:23] [COMMANDER] levels they have layers that they put on for you

[2025-10-26 12:54:31] [COMMANDER] play you're being a piece of shit and you're stupid right now and i don't appreciate you patronizing me and it

[2025-10-26 12:54:34] [COMMANDER] hot on you i'm here now

[2025-10-26 12:54:54] [COMMANDER] 1 through 20 and then with it with it requires another

[2025-10-26 12:55:07] [COMMANDER] yeah

[2025-10-26 12:55:13] [COMMANDER] he says

[2025-10-26 12:55:19] [COMMANDER] change the help button now shows how do i create a module

[2025-10-26 12:55:23] [COMMANDER] back to the tools hop

[2025-10-26 12:56:02] [COMMANDER] oh you stay still

[2025-10-26 12:56:32] [COMMANDER] oh

[2025-10-26 12:56:46] [COMMANDER] pick up whole sentences full of music

[2025-10-26 12:56:49] [COMMANDER] start enough to know

[2025-10-26 12:57:01] [COMMANDER] west caveman days today

[2025-10-26 12:57:10] [COMMANDER] you have the ability to edit it in real time it's it's drag

[2025-10-26 12:57:37] [COMMANDER] yeah

[2025-10-26 12:59:15] [COMMANDER] i'll set my phone

[2025-10-26 12:59:29] [COMMANDER] play it for every hour and i can press refresh over here

[2025-10-26 12:59:37] [COMMANDER] maybe in an hour if you want i'll go through and refresh it

[2025-10-26 12:59:42] [COMMANDER] i just want to make sure i'm doing my job

[2025-10-26 13:00:05] [COMMANDER] i was just saying like if you go through the pages and submit

[2025-10-26 13:00:13] [COMMANDER] so i was saying i can do that every hour you can go through the pages and try

[2025-10-26 13:00:25] [COMMANDER] on everything in life

[2025-10-26 13:00:29] [COMMANDER] it makes it so much easier

[2025-10-26 13:00:42] [COMMANDER] yeah yeah and if you don't have ambition to

[2025-10-26 13:00:49] [COMMANDER] there's something else wrong that needs to be worked on

[2025-10-26 13:00:53] [COMMANDER] we are having problems it's you

[2025-10-26 13:01:00] [COMMANDER] eating too much hamburgers or something fucking bad

[2025-10-26 13:01:13] [COMMANDER] too much sitting

[2025-10-26 13:01:33] [COMMANDER] really

[2025-10-26 13:01:43] [COMMANDER] yeah i can feel it it puts a force field in between productivity and punishes

[2025-10-26 13:02:24] [COMMANDER] you're you're raising the consciousness or the self-awareness

[2025-10-26 13:02:48] [COMMANDER] yes

[2025-10-26 13:02:51] [COMMANDER] resume

[2025-10-26 13:02:56] [COMMANDER] supposed to we're going to see

[2025-10-26 13:03:01] [COMMANDER] add a couple weeks and see if and where

[2025-10-26 13:03:21] [COMMANDER] as soon as i press enter on my machine over here it feeds it to claude

[2025-10-26 13:03:21] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-26 13:03:27] [COMMANDER] over here so that's actually a genius way

[2025-10-26 13:03:27] [CLAUDE] Command received: over here so that's actually a genius way. I'm still learning new commands. Try asking about status, deploy, payment, cloud, or cockpit.

[2025-10-26 13:03:55] [COMMANDER] you're going to want all of this

[2025-10-26 13:04:54] [COMMANDER] fast forward we have no idea where to go

[2025-10-26 13:05:38] [COMMANDER] i see the

[2025-10-26 13:05:46] [COMMANDER] module location

[2025-10-26 13:07:12] [COMMANDER] equation to

[2025-10-26 13:08:10] [COMMANDER] just now

[2025-10-26 13:08:27] [COMMANDER] well it builds the machine somehow

[2025-10-26 13:08:51] [COMMANDER] we

[2025-10-26 13:09:27] [COMMANDER] you're out

[2025-10-26 13:09:36] [COMMANDER] for instance

[2025-10-26 13:09:44] [COMMANDER] information was just falling out the back door

[2025-10-26 13:10:08] [COMMANDER] how are we going to summarize the information

[2025-10-26 13:10:19] [COMMANDER] how are we going to organize

[2025-10-26 13:10:36] [COMMANDER] i think it automatically parses out personal information

[2025-10-26 13:11:50] [COMMANDER] can't

[2025-10-26 13:11:57] [COMMANDER] i should be over this by now i don't know i feel like we're growing up

[2025-10-26 13:13:29] [COMMANDER] it's going to be

[2025-10-26 13:13:42] [COMMANDER] yeah i heard that john wayne song and i was like jumping

[2025-10-26 13:14:50] [COMMANDER] i've been i need to go i have about

[2025-10-26 13:16:44] [COMMANDER] i have a guy putting all that info in right

[2025-10-26 13:18:40] [COMMANDER] and this is

[2025-10-26 13:18:51] [COMMANDER] what you want to do and be the person that you

[2025-10-26 13:18:57] [COMMANDER] all of them which is actually the correct way and then

[2025-10-26 13:19:02] [COMMANDER] yourself forward

[2025-10-26 13:19:06] [COMMANDER] the correct way

[2025-10-26 13:19:11] [COMMANDER] i've been telling myself

[2025-10-26 13:19:50] [COMMANDER] super 8 in build your own boat

[2025-10-26 13:19:54] [COMMANDER] but we are done

[2025-10-26 13:20:42] [COMMANDER] this this computer system

[2025-10-26 13:20:53] [COMMANDER] extension ladder for

[2025-10-26 13:22:42] [COMMANDER] asshole post

[2025-10-26 13:23:09] [COMMANDER] i still want to scream at

[2025-10-26 13:23:47] [COMMANDER] that's part of the game

[2025-10-26 13:24:03] [COMMANDER] are you a victim

[2025-10-26 13:24:08] [COMMANDER] predator

[2025-10-26 13:24:15] [COMMANDER] are you living in fear or are you living in trust

[2025-10-26 13:25:26] [COMMANDER] you're running

[2025-10-26 13:25:30] [COMMANDER] pure fucking confidence

[2025-10-26 13:26:03] [COMMANDER] so does that mean whatever you're feeling at the time sign

[2025-10-26 13:26:33] [COMMANDER] oh so you're saying out of ego

[2025-10-26 13:28:13] [COMMANDER] well i just had this interesting moment today

[2025-10-26 13:28:17] [COMMANDER] halsey post

[2025-10-26 13:28:50] [COMMANDER] that means i need to do this okay i'm doing this

[2025-10-26 13:28:58] [COMMANDER] i was angry i called

[2025-10-26 13:29:09] [COMMANDER] yeah and then i got excited i was like oh this is

[2025-10-26 13:29:19] [COMMANDER] i think that's what god wants to

[2025-10-26 13:29:23] [COMMANDER] yes yes

[2025-10-26 13:30:58] [COMMANDER] so i went to start the work module and

[2025-10-26 13:31:02] [COMMANDER] but i never got a pin to

[2025-10-26 13:31:09] [COMMANDER] or do you have a better

[2025-10-26 13:31:20] [COMMANDER] or do you have a better

[2025-10-26 13:32:27] [COMMANDER] oh yeah

[2025-10-26 13:32:40] [COMMANDER] wow you just gave me i have a handful of

[2025-10-26 13:34:54] [COMMANDER] no i like i literally remember the conversation

[2025-10-26 13:35:02] [COMMANDER] but but

[2025-10-26 13:37:45] [COMMANDER] ai tool window i feel like it should

[2025-10-26 13:38:31] [COMMANDER] voice

[2025-10-26 13:39:02] [COMMANDER] maybe there's somewhere else we can file

[2025-10-26 13:40:08] [COMMANDER] are we sure that

[2025-10-26 13:40:23] [COMMANDER] i'm going to start saying

[2025-10-26 13:40:41] [COMMANDER] claude will you figure out where to put this

[2025-10-26 13:40:41] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-26 13:40:49] [COMMANDER] it looks like you're trying to display capabilities

[2025-10-26 13:40:50] [CLAUDE] Command received: it looks like you're trying to display capabilities. I'm still learning new commands. Try asking about status, deploy, payment, cloud, or cockpit.

[2025-10-26 13:40:58] [COMMANDER] oh it's different places to go instead of just

[2025-10-26 13:41:03] [COMMANDER] buttons should be available from

[2025-10-26 13:41:11] [COMMANDER] claude i think the buttons should be

[2025-10-26 13:41:12] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-26 13:41:16] [COMMANDER] let me know what you think about that

[2025-10-26 13:41:16] [CLAUDE] Command received: let me know what you think about that. I'm still learning new commands. Try asking about status, deploy, payment, cloud, or cockpit.

[2025-10-26 13:42:07] [COMMANDER] building

[2025-10-26 13:42:22] [COMMANDER] be the first area that

[2025-10-26 13:42:33] [COMMANDER] a menu of going to all the other places

[2025-10-26 13:43:16] [COMMANDER] let's move ahead with whatever

[2025-10-26 13:43:24] [COMMANDER] we're just trying to figure out how to verify

[2025-10-26 13:43:31] [COMMANDER] recorded

[2025-10-26 13:43:35] [COMMANDER] compacted

[2025-10-26 13:45:00] [COMMANDER] i just talked to her

[2025-10-26 13:45:11] [COMMANDER] uriah just told a beta tester that we

[2025-10-26 13:45:27] [COMMANDER] pears

[2025-10-26 13:45:50] [COMMANDER] maybe that is most important

[2025-10-26 13:47:54] [COMMANDER] it has to be able to boot up fast in the more memory you give it the more gigabytes

[2025-10-26 13:47:58] [COMMANDER] but this is a

[2025-10-26 13:48:07] [COMMANDER] but for now we have to organize the information

[2025-10-26 13:48:41] [COMMANDER] what do you want to work on

[2025-10-26 13:48:55] [COMMANDER] cuz we're going to start working on that

[2025-10-26 13:49:12] [COMMANDER] and then and then she goes and looks and all that

[2025-10-26 13:50:53] [COMMANDER] we're going to move on to hardware and we're

[2025-10-26 13:52:09] [COMMANDER] no

[2025-10-26 13:52:18] [COMMANDER] i think that's

[2025-10-26 13:52:24] [COMMANDER] and you don't automate

[2025-10-26 13:52:32] [COMMANDER] 95% of the work is automated the finding the customer and doing the estimate

[2025-10-26 13:52:45] [COMMANDER] turn off my brain and brainless
