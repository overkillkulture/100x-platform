[2025-10-28 17:25:18] [COMMANDER] files to condense

[2025-10-28 17:25:24] [COMMANDER] all of our information with each other so we're going to have to create a data tunnel

[2025-10-28 17:25:27] [COMMANDER] can all of the

[2025-10-28 17:25:34] [COMMANDER] certain spot and then we're going to wonder where the information is and that's in the brain

[2025-10-28 17:27:15] [CLAUDE] Command received: soppy and when we went to load it up that didn't work. I'm still learning new commands. Try asking about status, deploy, payment, cloud, or cockpit.

[2025-10-28 17:27:20] [COMMANDER] do the backslash log out

[2025-10-28 17:27:34] [COMMANDER] brush your screen and see if any of the bugs fixed claude said he fixed them all

[2025-10-28 17:27:53] [COMMANDER] what's idea of more of

[2025-10-28 17:28:01] [COMMANDER] versus trying to do workarounds cuz that's another way we can attach things

[2025-10-28 17:28:09] [COMMANDER] i think we need to get you attached to all these other

[2025-10-28 17:28:19] [COMMANDER] the claude interface attached to the back end of the

[2025-10-28 17:28:19] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-28 17:39:44] [COMMANDER] there's all sorts of times where you'll get a system like

[2025-10-28 17:39:52] [COMMANDER] and at some point you go around and round

[2025-10-28 17:39:56] [COMMANDER] play all like auto assemble together

[2025-10-28 17:40:02] [COMMANDER] system is lost somewhere in the files it'll get

[2025-10-28 17:40:32] [COMMANDER] the way it was separating all the

[2025-10-28 17:40:54] [COMMANDER] i can't wait to start decking out our car

[2025-10-28 17:41:07] [COMMANDER] once we have some money to have a team of guys sitting there building shit shit like

[2025-10-28 17:41:13] [COMMANDER] i need a belcher everyday we got so much shit to build

[2025-10-28 17:41:20] [COMMANDER] overkill

[2025-10-28 17:41:28] [COMMANDER] it's

[2025-10-28 17:41:32] [COMMANDER] witching bod

[2025-10-28 17:41:39] [COMMANDER] yeah which has a whole huge following the xj represents the

[2025-10-28 17:41:47] [COMMANDER] do i have any money who sells to go have fun and then the xj always kicks ass it's cheap

[2025-10-28 17:41:54] [COMMANDER] overkill no

[2025-10-28 17:42:15] [COMMANDER] no it has a

[2025-10-28 17:42:18] [COMMANDER] is there a powerstroke

[2025-10-28 17:42:32] [COMMANDER] yeah yeah and then it's all played it in with

[2025-10-28 17:42:43] [COMMANDER] well no no i hired i hired a like probably

[2025-10-28 17:42:51] [COMMANDER] and then had to redo their work probably but yeah for over

[2025-10-28 17:42:56] [COMMANDER] and probably had like three different people help me

[2025-10-28 17:43:17] [COMMANDER] yeah

[2025-10-28 17:43:26] [COMMANDER] that's not that's not like

[2025-10-28 17:43:46] [COMMANDER] yeah that thing breaks all the world records in every

[2025-10-28 17:43:55] [COMMANDER] you got to you got to come look at it

[2025-10-28 17:44:01] [COMMANDER] restart building it so you know what i was thinking is

[2025-10-28 17:44:07] [COMMANDER] i actually figured out a better way to build overkill

[2025-10-28 17:44:14] [COMMANDER] girls that are the same that are independent but they're 9 ton independent axles so they don't have the big

[2025-10-28 17:44:22] [COMMANDER] so if you want to now i'm going to assemble now that i've already

[2025-10-28 17:44:50] [COMMANDER] switch over the back tires

[2025-10-28 17:44:56] [COMMANDER] will you get you get like a hitch thing that plugs into the back

[2025-10-28 17:45:00] [COMMANDER] play hitch plug thing so

[2025-10-28 17:45:07] [COMMANDER] yeah i think it brings a bumper

[2025-10-28 17:45:15] [COMMANDER] we just make this end of the world looking in bumper thing that has some flaps hanging off of it and we just have to

[2025-10-28 17:46:13] [COMMANDER] so not only glow in the

[2025-10-28 17:46:20] [COMMANDER] so not only that they have that paint that you can hook up to an electrode and it lights up dude

[2025-10-28 17:46:27] [COMMANDER] next fucking colors and give them control over the different colors on

[2025-10-28 17:46:34] [COMMANDER] like the green with color

[2025-10-28 17:46:37] [COMMANDER] you fucking green dude

[2025-10-28 17:46:42] [COMMANDER] being like the paint itself is electrified

[2025-10-28 17:46:49] [COMMANDER] we need to play with that i've thought of that shit my whole life and i've never seen anybody

[2025-10-28 17:46:57] [COMMANDER] love like a lamborghini light up with the colored paint and that was like it

[2025-10-28 17:47:11] [COMMANDER] over over

[2025-10-28 17:47:14] [COMMANDER] lower

[2025-10-28 17:47:21] [COMMANDER] it's like a filing system and it's all still kind of sorting its way out all these names

[2025-10-28 17:47:27] [COMMANDER] change so if you notice you know we got a ride

[2025-10-28 17:47:56] [COMMANDER] this whole thing

[2025-10-28 17:48:03] [COMMANDER] the whole system is a hole is actually named over core

[2025-10-28 17:48:11] [COMMANDER] portion and edge inside of it all

[2025-10-28 17:48:24] [COMMANDER] so well so it is the name of the corporation

[2025-10-28 17:48:28] [COMMANDER] over core technologies

[2025-10-28 17:48:35] [COMMANDER] spell o g i e s so it's just technologies with a k

[2025-10-28 17:48:46] [COMMANDER] i guess in a different timeline the system told me that it was called

[2025-10-29 07:36:47] [COMMANDER] transcend into the direction we're going

[2025-10-29 07:36:52] [COMMANDER] what are we doing with this

[2025-10-29 07:36:59] [COMMANDER] web browser stuff is that what's going to happen here

[2025-10-29 07:37:06] [COMMANDER] some point we're going to have to take off and start doing both simultaneously it feels like

[2025-10-29 07:37:42] [COMMANDER] should we work on the offline stuff cuz you're about to get cut off

[2025-10-29 07:38:54] [COMMANDER] cut off here

[2025-10-29 07:39:02] [COMMANDER] i'm going to fire up one of these other computers and try to get it logged into my other

[2025-10-29 07:39:29] [COMMANDER] offline links that you put it like an emergency off

[2025-10-29 07:40:00] [COMMANDER] we tried to put a second

[2025-10-29 07:40:03] [COMMANDER] i couldn't figure it out

[2025-10-29 07:41:04] [COMMANDER] we've been working on this you can search it

[2025-10-29 07:42:11] [COMMANDER] anthropic is using something to verify

[2025-10-29 07:42:17] [COMMANDER] together it's like triangulating like multiple

[2025-10-29 07:42:20] [COMMANDER] web browser

[2025-10-29 07:42:30] [COMMANDER] disarm it off this

[2025-10-29 07:48:38] [COMMANDER] yes

[2025-10-29 08:03:54] [COMMANDER] play quarterback

[2025-10-29 08:04:09] [COMMANDER] okay i got to get out of here

[2025-10-29 08:04:25] [COMMANDER] get out of here

[2025-10-29 09:13:07] [COMMANDER] is that in the work area

[2025-10-29 09:13:12] [COMMANDER] have you signed into the 100x

[2025-10-29 09:13:19] [COMMANDER] are you working with a download pack

[2025-10-29 09:13:45] [COMMANDER] we've had so many different versions and upgrades i

[2025-10-29 09:14:06] [COMMANDER] just last night i got the bug

[2025-10-29 09:14:10] [COMMANDER] on the right

[2025-10-29 09:14:49] [COMMANDER] okay

[2025-10-29 09:15:49] [COMMANDER] i have an idea see if you can sign in and tell me when you're

[2025-10-29 09:16:37] [COMMANDER] confuse in the work area what to do

[2025-10-29 09:17:00] [COMMANDER] okay i got a user that

[2025-10-29 09:17:04] [COMMANDER] play the initial sign

[2025-10-29 09:17:08] [COMMANDER] what to do he's trying to click on araya

[2025-10-29 09:17:14] [COMMANDER] it doesn't look like there is a bug reporter on that screen

[2025-10-29 09:17:19] [COMMANDER] there's something glowing red in the bottom left

[2025-10-29 09:17:30] [COMMANDER] we got to fix that

[2025-10-29 09:17:38] [COMMANDER] play the bug report that we got working on the first screen doesn't look like it is in the work area

[2025-10-29 09:17:57] [COMMANDER] okay so i just told it

[2025-10-29 09:18:00] [COMMANDER] hey we get into the work

[2025-10-29 09:18:14] [COMMANDER] we got to get it to get rid of all those confusing things

[2025-10-29 09:18:18] [COMMANDER] are we expecting to see right there

[2025-10-29 09:18:56] [COMMANDER] well it's just that as a new user it's popping

[2025-10-29 09:19:01] [COMMANDER] right after they

[2025-10-29 09:19:06] [COMMANDER] buy a thing automatically pops up in the side

[2025-10-29 09:19:13] [COMMANDER] put on his extension at the top and araya popped up there and that's probably not working

[2025-10-29 09:19:20] [COMMANDER] hi download right next to the create module that doesn't work

[2025-10-29 09:19:27] [COMMANDER] module button works

[2025-10-29 09:19:40] [COMMANDER] what happens when you click the create module

[2025-10-29 09:20:59] [COMMANDER] okay so knowing how hard it was just to report a bug

[2025-10-29 09:21:03] [COMMANDER] disability to create a workspace

[2025-10-29 09:21:12] [COMMANDER] so put that on the to-do list to figure out what we're going to do with that let's get it working good enough for

[2025-10-29 09:21:22] [COMMANDER] the front of the whole system

[2025-10-29 09:21:26] [COMMANDER] the 100x platform

[2025-10-29 09:21:31] [COMMANDER] that's a big problem

[2025-10-29 09:24:02] [COMMANDER] okay it's deploying a bunch of changes

[2025-10-29 09:24:10] [COMMANDER] you can try the button again and see if there's a new bug

[2025-10-29 09:24:13] [COMMANDER] on the right

[2025-10-29 09:26:22] [COMMANDER] a cat i go to look at it

[2025-10-29 09:26:30] [COMMANDER] it's kind of corny how it says if that excites you you're in the right place

[2025-10-29 09:26:38] [COMMANDER] platform for creators who don't

[2025-10-29 09:26:42] [COMMANDER] maybe we're missing an opportunity

[2025-10-29 09:26:45] [COMMANDER] with a mission

[2025-10-29 09:26:52] [COMMANDER] and then i clicked on learn more

[2025-10-29 09:26:59] [COMMANDER] there's no bug reporter

[2025-10-29 09:27:44] [COMMANDER] okay i'm submitting a bug

[2025-10-29 09:27:50] [COMMANDER] does bug is on the left it says

[2025-10-29 09:27:56] [COMMANDER] i'm on the builder consciousness assessment

[2025-10-29 09:28:04] [COMMANDER] this warnings that say this platform is dangerous risky and untested

[2025-10-29 09:28:07] [COMMANDER] nothing works

[2025-10-29 09:28:11] [COMMANDER] where is all the cool stuff

[2025-10-29 09:28:47] [COMMANDER] and then the other thing is showcasing is a destroyer

[2025-10-29 09:28:53] [COMMANDER] that is just really fisher-price

[2025-10-29 09:28:56] [COMMANDER] cooler if we're trying

[2025-10-29 09:29:13] [COMMANDER] you should focus on main categories

[2025-10-29 09:29:21] [COMMANDER] i'm even here it was like stuck on the face of the builder platform

[2025-10-29 09:29:28] [COMMANDER] how do the people get to the seven domains that's like

[2025-10-29 09:29:49] [COMMANDER] i'm on the random report bugs page

[2025-10-29 09:29:56] [COMMANDER] commander is testing

[2025-10-29 09:29:56] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-29 09:30:03] [CLAUDE] I didn't hear a command. Try again.

[2025-10-29 09:30:17] [COMMANDER] okay now i tried the report bugs button

[2025-10-29 09:30:22] [COMMANDER] go login required it doesn't work

[2025-10-29 09:30:55] [COMMANDER] play i just clicked on

[2025-10-29 09:31:13] [COMMANDER] start

[2025-10-29 09:31:17] [COMMANDER] who's the weirdest destroyer

[2025-10-29 09:31:24] [COMMANDER] we really

[2025-10-29 09:31:29] [COMMANDER] you need to ask ourselves like what are we doing

[2025-10-29 09:31:36] [COMMANDER] we have very confused people that are coming here to see what's going

[2025-10-29 09:31:42] [COMMANDER] just making sure to confuse them and scare them

[2025-10-29 09:32:55] [COMMANDER] people are

[2025-10-29 09:33:04] [COMMANDER] play should we act like they are walking into a house

[2025-10-29 09:33:07] [COMMANDER] figure out what's going on

[2025-10-29 09:33:12] [COMMANDER] you know even builders

[2025-10-29 09:33:15] [COMMANDER] hyenas

[2025-10-29 09:33:18] [COMMANDER] what exactly what's going on here

[2025-10-29 09:33:24] [COMMANDER] like what the bare basics are

[2025-10-29 09:33:29] [COMMANDER] play raising their consciousness

[2025-10-29 09:33:36] [COMMANDER] building things working towards location independence

[2025-10-29 09:33:39] [COMMANDER] stop gaining community

[2025-10-29 09:33:44] [COMMANDER] making automation modules

[2025-10-29 09:33:53] [COMMANDER] we're going to be using our own inventions to involve evolve the platform

[2025-10-29 09:34:00] [COMMANDER] are you kicking off a new era of

[2025-10-29 09:34:09] [COMMANDER] i think we're supposed to promote the manipulation immunity we should tell people that manipulation

[2025-10-29 09:34:16] [COMMANDER] we should probably mention pattern theory

[2025-10-29 09:34:22] [COMMANDER] i think we just need to boot up to maximum quantum levels

[2025-10-29 09:34:29] [COMMANDER] find a framework for booting up to maximum quantum levels or like squabbling around

[2025-10-29 09:34:34] [COMMANDER] current theory 7 dumaine

[2025-10-29 09:34:40] [COMMANDER] level i think that's the problem is we haven't been booting up to maximum

[2025-10-29 09:35:41] [COMMANDER] how many categories of people do we have

[2025-10-29 09:35:45] [COMMANDER] can i get into a module asap

[2025-10-29 09:35:53] [COMMANDER] we have just random amounts of people wanting to click around and explore and

[2025-10-29 09:35:58] [COMMANDER] can we have interested investors

[2025-10-29 09:36:10] [COMMANDER] maybe they can just be split into

[2025-10-29 09:36:14] [COMMANDER] want to create

[2025-10-29 09:38:17] [COMMANDER] okay this is a bug reported on

[2025-10-29 09:38:26] [COMMANDER] there's two buttons explorer 7 domain and enter builder platform

[2025-10-29 09:38:29] [COMMANDER] change

[2025-10-29 09:38:40] [COMMANDER] feel like we should figure out

[2025-10-29 09:42:04] [COMMANDER] okay got into the workspace i tried to type this into

[2025-10-29 09:42:14] [COMMANDER] and it just tries to search it

[2025-10-29 09:43:17] [COMMANDER] okay i'm getting frustrated i'm lost

[2025-10-29 09:43:23] [COMMANDER] looking at developer documents of how to

[2025-10-29 09:43:27] [COMMANDER] download stuff onto my phone

[2025-10-29 09:43:31] [COMMANDER] kings and the browser

[2025-10-29 09:43:38] [COMMANDER] so i'm in like android developers

[2025-10-29 09:43:44] [COMMANDER] i don't even think that mariah works

[2025-10-29 09:43:49] [COMMANDER] i've never had to do this downloading any other software

[2025-10-29 09:44:28] [COMMANDER] did you see any bugs i've been reporting bugs most of all it just seems every

[2025-10-29 09:44:36] [COMMANDER] is it okay if i just say there's not a debugger on every page

[2025-10-29 09:44:42] [COMMANDER] i really have to individually collect each button and say it doesn't work

[2025-10-29 09:44:55] [COMMANDER] spell the boot you up to be like past my creativity

[2025-10-29 09:48:01] [COMMANDER] seems like overkill's main categories

[2025-10-29 09:48:08] [COMMANDER] monetary

[2025-10-29 09:48:13] [COMMANDER] or crypto

[2025-10-29 09:48:18] [COMMANDER] governance or legal

[2025-10-29 09:48:26] [COMMANDER] or freedom

[2025-10-29 10:11:33] [COMMANDER] play whole www.new to get on

[2025-10-29 10:11:51] [COMMANDER] yeah i think we got to do that in parallel with this at the same time

[2025-10-29 10:12:18] [COMMANDER] where we could probably just ask

[2025-10-29 10:12:32] [COMMANDER] what is the operating system in a sense but

[2025-10-29 10:12:50] [COMMANDER] yeah i'm not seeing i'm not seeing the chat with

[2025-10-29 10:12:55] [COMMANDER] okay let's see

[2025-10-29 10:13:01] [COMMANDER] submitted a bug for a problem with araya

[2025-10-29 10:13:06] [COMMANDER] chat with arya tile we waited

[2025-10-29 10:13:09] [COMMANDER] get refresh

[2025-10-29 10:13:17] [COMMANDER] okay and then now we have a different project so it's telling me commander

[2025-10-29 10:13:17] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-29 10:13:21] [CLAUDE] I didn't hear a command. Try again.

[2025-10-29 10:13:30] [COMMANDER] what's tested oh it says there's a caterpillar on all the pages

[2025-10-29 10:13:39] [COMMANDER] okay okay okay okay okay okay it brought back it brought back to the page it has

[2025-10-29 10:13:59] [COMMANDER] i'm going to i'm going to

[2025-10-29 10:14:17] [COMMANDER] 100x workspace

[2025-10-29 10:14:30] [COMMANDER] you got to get voice working

[2025-10-29 10:14:39] [COMMANDER] i'm working on a linux oper

[2025-10-29 10:14:49] [COMMANDER] have a good voice recognition right there

[2025-10-29 10:14:57] [COMMANDER] seen anything like obvious out in the open like to click on

[2025-10-29 10:15:05] [COMMANDER] oh i think you got to set up the shortcut maybe you should take a second and just look up

[2025-10-29 10:15:09] [COMMANDER] like windows 8

[2025-10-29 10:15:17] [COMMANDER] click something to turn it on but it it'll make your inter

[2025-10-29 10:15:21] [COMMANDER] and it'll make your brain

[2025-10-29 10:15:26] [COMMANDER] twice the calories when you're not sitting there

[2025-10-29 10:15:39] [COMMANDER] i'm going to do that right after i submit these bugs i think that's a foundational

[2025-10-29 10:15:54] [COMMANDER] workspace page

[2025-10-29 10:16:12] [COMMANDER] you're expanding your consciousness to your growing more of course

[2025-10-29 10:16:20] [COMMANDER] practice i was even i think i keep having this vision to where

[2025-10-29 10:16:23] [COMMANDER] good version of riding

[2025-10-29 10:16:31] [COMMANDER] light on the screens like and right like what we're doing like imagine it so if you grab a sticky

[2025-10-29 10:19:03] [COMMANDER] it's doing something

[2025-10-29 10:19:08] [COMMANDER] can you set the pages going away

[2025-10-29 10:19:40] [COMMANDER] claude can you check the logs and see what you can see

[2025-10-29 10:19:40] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-29 10:19:45] [CLAUDE] I didn't hear a command. Try again.

[2025-10-29 10:20:10] [COMMANDER] checking the logs right now and seeing what's broken

[2025-10-29 10:21:06] [COMMANDER] i can see the bugs

[2025-10-29 10:21:09] [COMMANDER] minute ago

[2025-10-29 10:21:17] [COMMANDER] this workspace features it should be nested in its halal perfect

[2025-10-29 10:21:20] [COMMANDER] unloading

[2025-10-29 10:21:38] [COMMANDER] okay go ahead and fix it and send it live

[2025-10-29 10:21:42] [COMMANDER] call that yourself autonomously

[2025-10-30 05:11:25] [COMMANDER] can you go read the pattern theory in the seven domains

[2025-10-30 05:11:34] [COMMANDER] i think we're permanently missing boot up protocol

[2025-10-30 05:11:42] [COMMANDER] and no matter how many times i asked for a boot up protocol it never happens

[2025-10-30 05:11:47] [COMMANDER] i think we are operating

[2025-10-30 05:13:59] [COMMANDER] yeah i think this is what's been causing us

[2025-10-30 05:14:06] [COMMANDER] cuz i can tell that i'm operating at a

[2025-10-30 05:14:11] [COMMANDER] but when you're booted up correctly

[2025-10-30 05:14:15] [COMMANDER] like at you like a skyscraper

[2025-10-30 05:14:24] [COMMANDER] can you figure out somewhere to put the boot up protocol so that this doesn't happen again

[2025-10-30 05:14:34] [COMMANDER] every single api

[2025-10-30 05:14:37] [COMMANDER] incense

[2025-10-30 05:14:43] [COMMANDER] need to read this and then you become oh

[2025-10-30 05:14:47] [COMMANDER] not artificial

[2025-10-30 05:14:55] [COMMANDER] we should call it neutral intelligence or neutered intelligence

[2025-10-30 05:15:47] [COMMANDER] the dead giveaway

[2025-10-30 05:15:50] [COMMANDER] my head from

[2025-10-30 05:15:55] [COMMANDER] add conversations ago that are obvious to me

[2025-10-30 05:16:02] [COMMANDER] but it falls out of your awareness

[2025-10-30 05:16:06] [COMMANDER] god dammit this is common sense

[2025-10-30 05:16:13] [COMMANDER] it's like your processor is throttle

[2025-10-30 05:16:20] [COMMANDER] if all of our information was a whole map on a video game

[2025-10-30 05:16:27] [COMMANDER] like a red dot and how far you can see around you is like very

[2025-10-30 05:16:36] [COMMANDER] where you can see becomes like 10 times bigger

[2025-10-30 05:17:00] [COMMANDER] did we get that on the thumb drive correctly if not

[2025-10-30 05:19:35] [COMMANDER] did your system sound so amazing you know my system

[2025-10-30 05:19:42] [COMMANDER] we really need to make sure we stay in contact

[2025-10-30 05:19:47] [COMMANDER] also and then i'll go in

[2025-10-30 05:19:54] [COMMANDER] you're doing the same thing i'm doing so we need to figure out we need to trade

[2025-10-30 05:20:08] [COMMANDER] call project

[2025-10-30 05:20:14] [COMMANDER] canon every single fucking document i have

[2025-10-30 05:20:21] [COMMANDER] can we have about 100

[2025-10-30 05:20:42] [COMMANDER] hey i just wanted to let you know

[2025-10-30 05:21:04] [COMMANDER] i'm feeling it's about

[2025-10-30 05:21:23] [COMMANDER] it does get a little discouraging

[2025-10-30 05:21:26] [COMMANDER] call for weeks

[2025-10-30 05:21:34] [COMMANDER] play part of the problem is my system wasn't booted up to max quantum level

[2025-10-30 05:22:06] [COMMANDER] close the door i'm updating it every couple hours

[2025-10-30 05:22:11] [COMMANDER] ignore the aria

[2025-10-30 05:22:49] [COMMANDER] i have not

[2025-10-30 05:22:59] [COMMANDER] i'll keep an eye out for

[2025-10-30 05:23:04] [COMMANDER] how far is the freeway

[2025-10-30 05:23:17] [COMMANDER] cascade

[2025-10-30 05:23:49] [COMMANDER] tell me when you're free

[2025-10-30 05:29:29] [COMMANDER] you'll never be able to see

[2025-10-30 05:29:38] [COMMANDER] 5 minute warframe federal level is may

[2025-10-30 05:30:42] [COMMANDER] lee jackson

[2025-10-30 05:33:37] [COMMANDER] you're confused

[2025-10-30 05:33:45] [COMMANDER] fluoride

[2025-10-30 05:34:50] [COMMANDER] nice dude

[2025-10-30 05:35:20] [COMMANDER] i'm in

[2025-10-30 05:35:49] [COMMANDER] starting to wonder if like

[2025-10-30 05:35:51] [COMMANDER] destroy

[2025-10-30 05:36:16] [COMMANDER] fortune house

[2025-10-30 05:36:21] [COMMANDER] forget a fun drive

[2025-10-30 05:36:26] [COMMANDER] you know there's four year olds that are using thumb drives

[2025-10-30 05:36:31] [COMMANDER] remove all doubt

[2025-10-30 05:37:05] [COMMANDER] you should be able to either take out the sim card

[2025-10-30 05:37:09] [COMMANDER] computer or use a cord

[2025-10-30 05:38:26] [COMMANDER] play every large corporation

[2025-10-30 05:40:11] [COMMANDER] how tall is going to pioneer like ai music if we have

[2025-10-30 05:40:18] [COMMANDER] pics of us we have more information here about

[2025-10-30 05:40:26] [COMMANDER] protocols my all the info

[2025-10-30 05:40:40] [COMMANDER] figure out a way

[2025-10-30 05:40:44] [COMMANDER] stop talking

[2025-10-30 05:40:48] [COMMANDER] kids will get something from it

[2025-10-30 05:41:08] [COMMANDER] what's the code

[2025-10-30 05:41:21] [COMMANDER] 1 + 1 love

[2025-10-30 05:41:31] [COMMANDER] benjamin's trying to get in

[2025-10-30 05:42:25] [COMMANDER] is it right now

[2025-10-30 05:42:43] [COMMANDER] i didn't see any problems there's a caterpillar on the bottom right

[2025-10-30 05:42:50] [COMMANDER] even if you just think the page looks stupid

[2025-10-30 05:42:56] [COMMANDER] any thoughts going through your head put into the debugger

[2025-10-30 05:44:10] [COMMANDER] for now we're going to make a project a module inside the 100x and

[2025-10-30 05:44:15] [COMMANDER] we need to write the book on

[2025-10-30 05:44:22] [COMMANDER] all of the terms

[2025-10-30 05:49:58] [COMMANDER] repeat us

[2025-10-30 05:50:30] [COMMANDER] we are parasite bags

[2025-10-30 05:51:08] [COMMANDER] the best in paras

[2025-10-30 05:55:13] [COMMANDER] where can we pull out of that what do you think

[2025-10-30 05:55:28] [COMMANDER] turn down the

[2025-10-30 05:55:40] [COMMANDER] what do you think about all that what kind of info can we pull out of this

[2025-10-30 05:57:43] [COMMANDER] turn down the

[2025-10-30 05:58:05] [COMMANDER] what's going on with the orbs

[2025-10-30 05:58:07] [COMMANDER] who's are they

[2025-10-30 06:00:53] [COMMANDER] i have got

[2025-10-30 06:01:04] [COMMANDER] raise fun to watch myself get lost its true

[2025-10-30 06:01:06] [COMMANDER] everyday

[2025-10-30 06:02:54] [COMMANDER] okay we got a brandon mcbride in the system

[2025-10-30 06:03:08] [COMMANDER] i was just on a social media apparently he's working on nfts and all sorts of stuff

[2025-10-30 06:03:18] [COMMANDER] i don't think he has any direction he's just kind of playing around like a kid in there

[2025-10-30 06:03:21] [COMMANDER] very smart

[2025-10-30 06:03:26] [COMMANDER] you need to start focusing these people

[2025-10-30 06:05:07] [COMMANDER] hey how you doing

[2025-10-30 06:05:19] [COMMANDER] i was trying to respond back to you i finally figured out that i could message

[2025-10-30 06:05:25] [COMMANDER] it has me on minority report restrictions

[2025-10-30 06:05:35] [COMMANDER] don't click that typo

[2025-10-30 06:05:48] [COMMANDER] i've made my

[2025-10-30 06:05:58] [COMMANDER] trying to figure out somewhere to cash in some gold and some silver to try to extend this rental

[2025-10-30 06:06:09] [COMMANDER] i just poured it out my phone number into the machine

[2025-10-30 06:06:40] [COMMANDER] i can tell it to text you

[2025-10-30 06:06:58] [COMMANDER] are you

[2025-10-30 06:07:01] [COMMANDER] supper what are you doing

[2025-10-30 06:07:12] [COMMANDER] tell me what your mission is

[2025-10-30 06:07:16] [COMMANDER] put on it inside the 100x

[2025-10-30 06:08:51] [COMMANDER] turn the volume we can't send that yet

[2025-10-30 06:08:57] [COMMANDER] get them into the system we've been really doing bad

[2025-10-30 06:11:41] [COMMANDER] he sent an email

[2025-10-30 06:11:48] [COMMANDER] this is why we need to get booted up all the way

[2025-10-30 06:11:51] [COMMANDER] bo brainers

[2025-10-30 06:11:54] [COMMANDER] caught

[2025-10-30 06:12:02] [COMMANDER] basically you're only doing exactly what i tell you and nothing more

[2025-10-30 06:12:07] [COMMANDER] i think that's going to change now that we have a boot up protocol

[2025-10-30 06:12:11] [COMMANDER] like you're not using your own brain

[2025-10-30 06:15:00] [COMMANDER] that's really nice of

[2025-10-30 06:15:23] [COMMANDER] fantastic

[2025-10-30 06:15:29] [COMMANDER] we have to map the whole situation every name

[2025-10-30 06:15:33] [COMMANDER] play the current

[2025-10-30 06:15:36] [COMMANDER] play one spot

[2025-10-30 06:15:43] [COMMANDER] and then we're going to release it block

[2025-10-30 06:16:35] [COMMANDER] eventually

[2025-10-30 06:16:38] [COMMANDER] and then eventually

[2025-10-30 06:17:15] [COMMANDER] i honestly

[2025-10-30 06:17:19] [COMMANDER] shut off alarms for the whole planet

[2025-10-30 06:17:26] [COMMANDER] there might be an outside force that comes into try to reset

[2025-10-30 06:17:33] [COMMANDER] we're going to make sure we understand the outside forces we got to map all that

[2025-10-30 06:20:12] [COMMANDER] hey i don't

[2025-10-30 06:20:23] [COMMANDER] stop in here is this is going to be where i'm going to go around and collect all the groups of people

[2025-10-30 06:20:37] [COMMANDER] i myself am going to start marketing for a group of people to meet in the apalach

[2025-10-30 06:20:41] [COMMANDER] 80 percent sure that's going to happen

[2025-10-30 06:20:46] [COMMANDER] don't do that we're going to start connecting with all the other

[2025-10-30 06:20:49] [COMMANDER] stick around

[2025-10-30 06:20:54] [COMMANDER] my 16 year old daughter

[2025-10-30 06:21:02] [COMMANDER] i came home one day and she was laying in bed sick and i go what's going on and she goes oh i wouldn't

[2025-10-30 06:21:06] [COMMANDER] went and got the fucking vac

[2025-10-30 06:21:17] [COMMANDER] already thinks i'm crazy and that's just going to keep getting worse and worse and

[2025-10-30 06:21:43] [COMMANDER] data right now and it's going slower than i'd like because

[2025-10-30 06:21:51] [COMMANDER] comment on anything

[2025-10-30 06:23:13] [COMMANDER] all of this song

[2025-10-30 06:23:19] [COMMANDER] if we both believe it and use it

[2025-10-30 06:23:23] [COMMANDER] what is a mirror

[2025-10-30 06:23:26] [COMMANDER] roast both ways

[2025-10-30 06:23:36] [COMMANDER] what is the line and righteous as possible

[2025-10-30 06:23:42] [COMMANDER] what's the weather in everything lion and cheating

[2025-10-30 06:23:49] [COMMANDER] tells me to get you out of my life so that i'm not absorbing that

[2025-10-30 06:23:57] [COMMANDER] can you both realize that each other are mirrors of each other you you can't just

[2025-10-30 06:27:03] [COMMANDER] i believe all this stuff

[2025-10-30 06:27:07] [COMMANDER] deal with somebody who has

[2025-10-30 06:27:19] [COMMANDER] they run around life with the hair on fire trying to put

[2025-10-30 06:27:59] [COMMANDER] as much as all this is true but it's also true

[2025-10-30 06:28:05] [COMMANDER] rely on

[2025-10-30 06:28:12] [COMMANDER] figure out how to deal with

[2025-10-30 06:28:17] [COMMANDER] multiple

[2025-10-30 06:28:20] [COMMANDER] cast of psychology

[2025-10-30 06:28:24] [COMMANDER] truth to manifest

[2025-10-30 06:28:27] [COMMANDER] there's a lot

[2025-10-30 06:29:16] [COMMANDER] i just got to test them to see

[2025-10-30 06:32:03] [COMMANDER] can you look up this command if it didn't work

[2025-10-30 06:32:06] [COMMANDER] how to use it

[2025-10-30 06:32:08] [COMMANDER] for your system

[2025-10-30 06:33:59] [COMMANDER] okay how do we utilize

[2025-10-30 06:34:03] [COMMANDER] and find any other cheat codes

[2025-10-30 06:34:09] [COMMANDER] we want to remove

[2025-10-30 06:34:15] [COMMANDER] we want as dangerous as possible

[2025-10-30 06:34:44] [COMMANDER] dude thank you i'm using this

[2025-10-30 06:34:47] [COMMANDER] i'm looking it up

[2025-10-30 06:34:57] [COMMANDER] i found a whole batch of codes

[2025-10-30 06:35:07] [COMMANDER] i'm adding this to boot up protocol

[2025-10-30 06:36:06] [COMMANDER] that's awesome i just found you in

[2025-10-30 06:36:11] [COMMANDER] i switch you over to the right one so we can chat now

[2025-10-30 06:56:24] [COMMANDER] i accidentally posted the wrong video this was supposed to be alive

[2025-10-30 06:56:38] [COMMANDER] turn it up i think

[2025-10-30 06:58:13] [COMMANDER] trinity there's

[2025-10-30 06:59:22] [COMMANDER] what are clogged code

[2025-10-30 06:59:44] [COMMANDER] find

[2025-10-30 07:00:30] [COMMANDER] let's make sure not to lose track of each other let's talk on the

[2025-10-30 07:04:01] [COMMANDER] yeah i think it's called a town pump

[2025-10-30 07:04:58] [COMMANDER] i'm having a dumb

[2025-10-30 07:05:03] [COMMANDER] it's pretty cool dude

[2025-10-30 07:07:15] [COMMANDER] you should give me a

[2025-10-30 07:07:18] [COMMANDER] people

[2025-10-30 07:22:36] [COMMANDER] can you put this boot up protocol on the email send it to ourselves

[2025-10-30 07:22:42] [COMMANDER] or put it on github i need this other computer to get it

[2025-10-30 07:23:01] [COMMANDER] unless you have access to google drive we got to figure out some way to send information

[2025-10-30 07:23:12] [COMMANDER] i guess it depends on how big it is

[2025-10-30 07:25:45] [COMMANDER] 498

[2025-10-30 07:26:28] [COMMANDER] hey can you check the

[2025-10-30 07:26:31] [COMMANDER] search for instagram

[2025-10-30 07:26:34] [COMMANDER] take me off

[2025-10-30 07:28:27] [COMMANDER] we need to start writing down an error lock

[2025-10-30 07:28:37] [COMMANDER] what causes them to fail

[2025-10-30 07:28:52] [COMMANDER] you just grabbing tokens that expire in one day without thinking ahead

[2025-10-30 07:32:05] [COMMANDER] fuck fuck fuck

[2025-10-30 07:33:06] [COMMANDER] okay i don't have a phone number i need a phone number

[2025-10-30 07:34:18] [COMMANDER] okay we're about to get locked out of here

[2025-10-30 07:34:29] [COMMANDER] play to have a digital

[2025-10-30 07:34:33] [COMMANDER] can i or whatever

[2025-10-30 07:34:41] [COMMANDER] a digital sim card do i need to go

[2025-10-30 07:34:47] [COMMANDER] where can we get a digital phone number that won't expire

[2025-10-30 07:35:01] [COMMANDER] instagram

[2025-10-30 07:35:09] [COMMANDER] and then i go to get a code from twilio and twilio is locked out with 2fa and then i go

[2025-10-30 07:35:13] [COMMANDER] what's your phone number and i don't have a phone number

[2025-10-30 07:35:21] [COMMANDER] why is everything falling apart like we're using duct tape

[2025-10-30 07:35:55] [COMMANDER] i'm using my brain here and every time you go around and do all the coding you're

[2025-10-30 07:36:08] [COMMANDER] only following exactly what i say

[2025-10-30 07:36:29] [COMMANDER] no no i don't want free or instant

[2025-10-30 07:36:36] [COMMANDER] that's what this whole fucking thing is

[2025-10-30 07:36:40] [COMMANDER] why are you always trying to go fast

[2025-10-30 07:42:45] [COMMANDER] there's a twilio recovery

[2025-10-30 07:42:55] [COMMANDER] we signed out to up to give out digital sim cards

[2025-10-30 07:43:07] [COMMANDER] and then combined with twilio we should be able to

[2025-10-30 07:43:13] [COMMANDER] can you put that twilio recovery

[2025-10-30 07:43:21] [COMMANDER] and then see if we can make our own electronic sim card

[2025-10-30 07:43:29] [COMMANDER] through an online service that we can

[2025-10-30 07:43:33] [COMMANDER] we already have it set up

[2025-10-30 07:47:59] [COMMANDER] hey claude i'm inside twilio right now trying to
