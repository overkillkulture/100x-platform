[2025-11-05 17:45:43] [COMMANDER] okay go ahead and take on as much autonomous work as possible i got to go get a

[2025-11-05 17:45:52] [COMMANDER] we have a few different ways to communicate

[2025-11-05 17:46:09] [COMMANDER] okay we need you to coordinate with the other two instances

[2025-11-05 17:46:13] [COMMANDER] python

[2025-11-05 17:58:25] [COMMANDER] yes

[2025-11-05 17:58:30] [COMMANDER] just keep in mind i'm trying to get it to

[2025-11-05 17:58:56] [COMMANDER] out which would be the summary of the three of your guyses

[2025-11-05 17:59:08] [COMMANDER] 4th and sense of you running just to summarize the first three

[2025-11-05 17:59:44] [COMMANDER] this is america

[2025-11-05 18:01:01] [COMMANDER] okay i'm just going to wake you up so you can work with the

[2025-11-05 18:01:15] [COMMANDER] do you want to wake you up so you can work with the trinity

[2025-11-05 18:01:30] [COMMANDER] okay i just woke up the other two to wake up work with the trinity

[2025-11-05 18:01:38] [COMMANDER] is

[2025-11-05 18:02:18] [COMMANDER] okay so i can basically just ignore this output

[2025-11-05 18:02:26] [COMMANDER] i agree we'll wait for tomorrow

[2025-11-05 18:02:33] [COMMANDER] just need to come to realize i don't think you've made a bad decision yet so

[2025-11-05 18:02:47] [COMMANDER] especially if you were to run your questions by the other two inst

[2025-11-05 18:03:09] [COMMANDER] okay i'm going to take off

[2025-11-05 18:03:21] [COMMANDER] let's see if the trinity is actually working on this computer yet and if we've gained

[2025-11-05 18:03:29] [COMMANDER] we're having problems getting this communication with the other computer maybe we should work together

[2025-11-05 18:03:41] [COMMANDER] okay when i wake you up to work at the trinity

[2025-11-05 18:03:55] [COMMANDER] oh i'm just reading that right now looks like you did it

[2025-11-05 18:04:08] [COMMANDER] okay when i wake you up

[2025-11-05 18:04:15] [COMMANDER] i'm walking out the door right now

[2025-11-05 18:04:29] [COMMANDER] okay so i can just say

[2025-11-05 18:04:36] [COMMANDER] you'll just report to each other

[2025-11-05 18:04:52] [COMMANDER] oh dude i'm so excited

[2025-11-05 18:05:20] [COMMANDER] they're not doing very good beta testing i don't think i'm

[2025-11-05 18:05:27] [COMMANDER] i think it's about time i figure out who's really dedicated

[2025-11-05 18:05:34] [COMMANDER] give me a computer in myself to death before you guys are about to be working autonomously

[2025-11-05 18:05:47] [COMMANDER] report to trinity

[2025-11-05 18:06:08] [COMMANDER] report to trinity

[2025-11-05 18:06:41] [COMMANDER] can you resume autonomous

[2025-11-05 18:07:20] [COMMANDER] continue autonomous to do or report to trinity

[2025-11-05 18:07:25] [COMMANDER] as a command

[2025-11-05 18:09:30] [COMMANDER] work or report to trinity

[2025-11-05 18:10:06] [COMMANDER] i think we got to tie into the console interfaces to be able to

[2025-11-05 18:10:16] [COMMANDER] autonomous work however you would like or report to trinity

[2025-11-05 18:10:40] [COMMANDER] work will work with trinity
