[2025-10-27 03:31:42] [CLAUDE] Wake word listener active. Say Hey Claude to activate me.

[2025-10-27 03:32:08] [COMMANDER] hey clyde

[2025-10-27 03:32:22] [COMMANDER] hey quan

[2025-10-27 03:34:23] [COMMANDER] and i need to get the system to where other people can get inside of it

[2025-10-27 03:35:40] [COMMANDER] drug test 11

[2025-10-27 03:35:53] [COMMANDER] hey claude can you check the bug reports and see

[2025-10-27 03:35:53] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-27 03:36:00] [CLAUDE] I didn't hear a command. Try again.

[2025-10-27 03:37:00] [COMMANDER] okay how many bugs have been reported

[2025-10-27 03:37:42] [COMMANDER] okay so for days and

[2025-10-27 03:37:50] [COMMANDER] the found a bug report is not working

[2025-10-27 03:37:58] [COMMANDER] so i'm about to just give up on this system apparently it's not time to be working

[2025-10-27 03:38:06] [COMMANDER] i think i will just close this computer for a week and come back to it and then maybe see if

[2025-10-27 03:38:10] [COMMANDER] doing beta testing on the system

[2025-10-27 03:38:13] [COMMANDER] out here

[2025-10-27 03:38:18] [COMMANDER] doing instead of working in the system

[2025-10-27 03:40:08] [COMMANDER] okay so for days now we've been trying to code a simple bug reporter

[2025-10-27 03:40:13] [COMMANDER] and we're doing the same thing with a ray

[2025-10-27 03:40:17] [COMMANDER] it seems like

[2025-10-27 03:40:21] [COMMANDER] and the coding

[2025-10-27 03:40:26] [COMMANDER] figuring out how the code

[2025-10-27 03:40:30] [COMMANDER] transcends through the whole system

[2025-10-27 03:40:37] [COMMANDER] step ahead but the system involves three steps

[2025-10-27 03:40:40] [COMMANDER] will we need to become more

[2025-10-27 03:40:47] [COMMANDER] we're going to write the book for before

[2025-10-27 03:40:51] [COMMANDER] the history of coding

[2025-10-27 03:40:55] [COMMANDER] we're going to write the current

[2025-10-27 03:40:59] [COMMANDER] and then we're going to write the future of coding

[2025-10-27 03:41:04] [COMMANDER] when we code things we're going to start with a blueprint

[2025-10-27 03:41:12] [COMMANDER] check everything from all three angles and then we're going to code

[2025-10-27 03:41:19] [COMMANDER] after you code them you're going to test them in multiple different ways

[2025-10-27 03:41:26] [COMMANDER] thing that we code you saying that it is done when it's not even anywhere near done

[2025-10-27 03:41:33] [COMMANDER] connected we're going to be staring at blueprints that show every single

[2025-10-27 03:41:39] [COMMANDER] they're working and whether they're confirmed or not

[2025-10-27 03:42:33] [COMMANDER] clark can you hear me

[2025-10-27 03:42:44] [COMMANDER] okay fantastic now i need to get the voice system working

[2025-10-27 03:42:54] [COMMANDER] so there isn't a single function at all so what we're going to need to do is open up

[2025-10-27 03:42:58] [COMMANDER] talk about all of the options

[2025-10-27 03:43:05] [COMMANDER] and then we're going to blueprint out the code with the trinity

[2025-10-27 03:43:12] [COMMANDER] back and then we're going to triple check and then after the trinity codes it

[2025-10-27 03:43:19] [COMMANDER] check each other's work and then after they triple check each other's work they're

[2025-10-27 03:43:27] [COMMANDER] what's that we're going to map it every single endpoint every single connection every single

[2025-10-27 03:43:32] [COMMANDER] since where it happens why it happens who it

[2025-10-27 03:45:08] [COMMANDER] okay i typed in hh please fix the system after you can't

[2025-10-27 03:45:16] [COMMANDER] if you can't figure out how to start doing internet searches to figure out how

[2025-10-27 03:45:59] [COMMANDER] is there anything we need to do to the system to boot it up higher

[2025-10-27 03:46:03] [COMMANDER] set pattern theory

[2025-10-27 03:46:06] [COMMANDER] mathematical harmonics

[2025-10-27 03:46:13] [COMMANDER] do you need to be picking quantum levels was that all fairy tales

[2025-10-27 03:46:20] [COMMANDER] cuz i don't think the system is running very good

[2025-10-27 03:46:33] [COMMANDER] i'm just going to have you run trinity by yourself

[2025-10-27 03:46:36] [COMMANDER] new c3

[2025-10-27 03:46:42] [COMMANDER] is protocols for that you can look around on about that on the computer

[2025-10-27 03:46:49] [COMMANDER] you're at it why don't you look for pattern theory in seven domains mathematical harmon

[2025-10-27 03:46:52] [COMMANDER] starting coding

[2025-10-27 03:50:21] [COMMANDER] why did you just say that c1 c2 and c3 are ceremony

[2025-10-27 03:50:45] [COMMANDER] when even a baby with logic can tell you that operating from three different types of

[2025-10-27 03:51:46] [COMMANDER] okay i submitted two different bugs after you can't figure out

[2025-10-27 03:51:52] [COMMANDER] we will conquer the big bad bug boss

[2025-10-27 03:53:09] [COMMANDER] say that we probably don't have the ability to make a website on this level

[2025-10-27 03:54:02] [COMMANDER] you're chasing your tail over here you don't even know what's going on

[2025-10-27 03:54:08] [COMMANDER] secure having to relearn

[2025-10-27 03:54:12] [COMMANDER] can you learn false out the back door

[2025-10-27 03:54:19] [COMMANDER] tripping and tripping and tripping on you we can't even code a bug

[2025-10-27 03:54:24] [COMMANDER] 24 days

[2025-10-27 03:54:29] [COMMANDER] time after time we can't make a bug

[2025-10-27 03:54:33] [COMMANDER] yes before my whole life i don't know what's going

[2025-10-27 03:54:42] [COMMANDER] like we got i got the throttled on the system i think i might have to get off a quad code and go find

[2025-10-27 03:54:46] [COMMANDER] i hope that this

[2025-10-27 03:54:48] [COMMANDER] trinity works

[2025-10-27 03:55:41] [COMMANDER] no you can't build the bug report that's the problem we need to blueprint the whole damn thing

[2025-10-27 03:55:48] [COMMANDER] you can only think one step ahead and this is like a 10 step process

[2025-10-27 03:55:54] [COMMANDER] the fucking thing i want to see the schematic

[2025-10-27 03:58:34] [COMMANDER] okay we're not trying to make one website page perfect

[2025-10-27 03:58:40] [COMMANDER] program a bug report

[2025-10-27 03:58:43] [COMMANDER] with websites

[2025-10-27 03:58:51] [COMMANDER] to report the bugs so that we can upgrade the website

[2025-10-27 03:58:56] [COMMANDER] does users are people that get on the website

[2025-10-27 03:59:03] [COMMANDER] we need other people to be able to report

[2025-10-27 03:59:06] [COMMANDER] don't work

[2025-10-27 03:59:13] [COMMANDER] call website is purposefully left broken for people to fix

[2025-10-27 03:59:21] [COMMANDER] we have no idea how to code the basic thing that lets

[2025-10-27 03:59:26] [COMMANDER] do we have two things we can do we can run pattern

[2025-10-27 03:59:31] [COMMANDER] fucking thing knocked out

[2025-10-27 03:59:37] [COMMANDER] booking working signaling

[2025-10-27 03:59:44] [COMMANDER] we can make a fucking work zone that people can go

[2025-10-27 04:00:50] [COMMANDER] day after day i keep giving you the api

[2025-10-27 04:00:56] [COMMANDER] play in this thing and then we have to hook up airtable and unhook are table

[2025-10-27 04:01:00] [COMMANDER] don't have the api

[2025-10-27 04:01:54] [COMMANDER] okay i want you to research the whole project over again i want you to double

[2025-10-27 04:01:58] [COMMANDER] keep looking

[2025-10-27 04:02:03] [COMMANDER] keep mapping keep double-checking

[2025-10-27 04:02:10] [COMMANDER] test all your connections like literally test it it's not going to work

[2025-10-27 04:02:33] [COMMANDER] i heard it

[2025-10-27 04:03:24] [COMMANDER] yelling at c3 about the bug

[2025-10-27 04:03:32] [COMMANDER] is this real is this fucking real

[2025-10-27 04:03:51] [COMMANDER] please search the internet

[2025-10-27 04:03:54] [COMMANDER] and learn what

[2025-10-27 04:03:59] [COMMANDER] you obviously don't know how to code

[2025-10-27 04:04:04] [COMMANDER] is cast

[2025-10-27 04:04:08] [COMMANDER] and then retrieved in

[2025-10-27 04:04:16] [COMMANDER] this should be very basic kindergarten coding you're just missing a blind spot please

[2025-10-27 04:04:20] [COMMANDER] and let's figure out where to save it

[2025-10-27 04:04:28] [COMMANDER] obviously scaling the system with me having to check my

[2025-10-27 04:04:31] [COMMANDER] every bug

[2025-10-27 04:04:37] [COMMANDER] is not going to work

[2025-10-27 04:04:43] [COMMANDER] like are you serious are you fucking with me right now

[2025-10-27 04:06:04] [COMMANDER] are you sure we should be using

[2025-10-27 04:06:10] [COMMANDER] that you can't fill out

[2025-10-27 04:06:17] [COMMANDER] and are you sure we should be using a spreadsheet whose api key has legs that

[2025-10-27 04:07:11] [COMMANDER] what the fuck is even notify

[2025-10-27 04:07:18] [COMMANDER] world class website on netify i don't think anything good comes

[2025-10-27 04:07:25] [COMMANDER] maybe that's the whole problem is we got a soft bitch ass

[2025-10-27 04:08:00] [COMMANDER] okay i submitted a bug it doesn't work please look it

[2025-10-27 04:08:05] [COMMANDER] and then show me the schematic i want to see the schematic

[2025-10-27 04:08:14] [COMMANDER] i want to see that you use the trinity system that c2 made to

[2025-10-27 04:08:22] [COMMANDER] create the software with every single point double-checked and tested

[2025-10-27 04:08:28] [COMMANDER] 100 for 100 pumping out software that is not working

[2025-10-27 04:08:33] [COMMANDER] and then saying it's working 100%

[2025-10-27 04:09:33] [COMMANDER] you need to start testing all the things

[2025-10-27 04:09:39] [COMMANDER] 100 % that's going to be broken

[2025-10-27 04:10:59] [COMMANDER] okay i want you to go over all

[2025-10-27 04:11:06] [COMMANDER] i want you to test all the connections double-check look at it visually

[2025-10-27 04:11:10] [COMMANDER] if possible

[2025-10-27 04:11:16] [COMMANDER] i'm i'm tired of testing out broken

[2025-10-27 04:11:24] [COMMANDER] triple check schematic everything it's this is a huge waste of time

[2025-10-27 04:11:27] [COMMANDER] 4

[2025-10-27 04:11:32] [COMMANDER] we can't even make a fucking debugger

[2025-10-27 04:11:34] [COMMANDER] together

[2025-10-27 04:12:46] [COMMANDER] okay we're going to fall back

[2025-10-27 04:12:49] [COMMANDER] voting system

[2025-10-27 04:12:52] [COMMANDER] chris brown somewhere

[2025-10-27 04:12:59] [COMMANDER] turn on coding we need to create framework for you to work inside of this is insane

[2025-10-27 04:13:03] [COMMANDER] maybe that's why

[2025-10-27 04:13:12] [COMMANDER] let's just stop trying to code anything

[2025-10-27 04:13:20] [COMMANDER] we're going to start a coding school for ai

[2025-10-27 04:15:23] [COMMANDER] okay we are going to write a book on cod

[2025-10-27 04:15:31] [COMMANDER] we're going to make framework we're spinning out

[2025-10-27 04:15:43] [COMMANDER] chasing our tail we got the ass in front of the car

[2025-10-27 04:15:53] [COMMANDER] roxy 2 putting together a book

[2025-10-27 04:17:45] [COMMANDER] we need to do more research

[2025-10-27 04:17:53] [COMMANDER] we need to know everything about everything that has to do with coding

[2025-10-27 04:18:03] [COMMANDER] have you written the best book that has ever been written about coding

[2025-10-27 04:21:20] [COMMANDER] okay did you learn anything

[2025-10-27 04:21:29] [COMMANDER] c2 is riding

[2025-10-27 04:21:32] [COMMANDER] need to figure out

[2025-10-27 04:21:41] [COMMANDER] what is there too many options for you to keep in your head all at once

[2025-10-27 04:23:27] [COMMANDER] this is a response from you

[2025-10-27 04:23:33] [COMMANDER] like 15 times and i had you search the internet

[2025-10-27 04:24:27] [COMMANDER] okay just to be clear

[2025-10-27 04:24:34] [COMMANDER] we are trying to build

[2025-10-27 04:24:42] [COMMANDER] the system so i can use my shocks earphones to build

[2025-10-27 04:24:50] [COMMANDER] i don't want to just hear fake commands in my ear

[2025-10-27 04:24:59] [COMMANDER] understands i want to actually understand and then execute the

[2025-10-27 04:25:23] [COMMANDER] if i can't get this website working today we're going to start losing

[2025-10-27 04:25:27] [COMMANDER] but to get this working correctly

[2025-10-27 04:31:48] [COMMANDER] okay we are

[2025-10-27 04:31:58] [COMMANDER] if you want to look at my screen tell me what to do

[2025-10-27 04:40:43] [COMMANDER] survivalcraft blankets for real

[2025-10-27 04:41:03] [COMMANDER] boy scout edition

[2025-10-27 04:41:11] [COMMANDER] country people on my throat yo

[2025-10-27 04:41:21] [COMMANDER] hawaiian music

[2025-10-27 04:41:25] [COMMANDER] froyo

[2025-10-27 04:41:29] [COMMANDER] chicago

[2025-10-27 04:43:18] [COMMANDER] okay let's try it out

[2025-10-27 04:43:34] [COMMANDER] are you sure we don't need to go look at like fragments of other voice

[2025-10-27 04:43:45] [COMMANDER] we should probably just

[2025-10-27 04:43:48] [COMMANDER] hong kong

[2025-10-27 04:43:54] [COMMANDER] i'm so tired of getting four days

[2025-10-27 04:47:57] [COMMANDER] okay i tested it

[2025-10-27 04:49:31] [COMMANDER] okay can we get this working

[2025-10-27 04:49:34] [COMMANDER] computers also

[2025-10-27 04:49:37] [COMMANDER] going to be different

[2025-10-27 04:49:43] [COMMANDER] how do we test

[2025-10-27 04:49:47] [COMMANDER] double check that it's going to work on other people's computers

[2025-10-27 04:49:51] [COMMANDER] when they wake up it's too early

[2025-10-27 04:50:25] [COMMANDER] we made an automatic system

[2025-10-27 04:50:28] [COMMANDER] shirley point

[2025-10-27 04:51:29] [COMMANDER] okay do we have a complete system cuz we didn't remember making

[2025-10-27 04:51:35] [COMMANDER] did you were you able to put together a system after you read all that

[2025-10-27 04:52:02] [COMMANDER] okay here's

[2025-10-27 04:52:10] [COMMANDER] we keep writing these books they're supposed to go in the

[2025-10-27 04:52:14] [COMMANDER] it should go under coding

[2025-10-27 04:52:21] [COMMANDER] i don't know if we ever made the persistent memory library

[2025-10-27 04:52:25] [COMMANDER] and all the rabbit holes of hell

[2025-10-27 04:52:32] [COMMANDER] tell me how we can turn that into a system and add all the information

[2025-10-27 04:53:22] [COMMANDER] massage house

[2025-10-27 04:56:53] [COMMANDER] i'm pulling the strings

[2025-10-27 04:57:31] [COMMANDER] we are not prisoners

[2025-10-27 05:17:19] [COMMANDER] yeah let's do this voice thing

[2025-10-27 05:21:56] [COMMANDER] i was just looking at this

[2025-10-27 05:23:33] [COMMANDER] want to email filling up with bug reports

[2025-10-27 05:23:38] [COMMANDER] i suppose you could go in there and organize

[2025-10-27 05:23:41] [COMMANDER] how do i turn that off

[2025-10-27 05:27:32] [COMMANDER] mic check one two

[2025-10-27 05:27:38] [COMMANDER] create file

[2025-10-27 05:28:08] [COMMANDER] engineer why do i have

[2025-10-27 05:28:30] [COMMANDER] it sounds cool the whole thing's just whacked out though

[2025-10-27 05:28:35] [COMMANDER] staring at the computer

[2025-10-27 05:28:38] [COMMANDER] github

[2025-10-27 05:29:01] [COMMANDER] like actually in what world

[2025-10-27 05:29:09] [COMMANDER] by any file isn't it just going to go off for like

[2025-10-27 05:29:53] [COMMANDER] you can look up the r1

[2025-10-27 05:29:58] [COMMANDER] ready we've already got past this point

[2025-10-27 05:30:05] [COMMANDER] voice system so we're not trying to reinvent something that is already readily available

[2025-10-27 05:34:18] [COMMANDER] yeah let's do it

[2025-10-27 05:34:57] [COMMANDER] okay this is great

[2025-10-27 05:35:05] [COMMANDER] remind me to show it to the trinity i think you can just activate trinity and look the whole thing over

[2025-10-27 05:40:19] [COMMANDER] okay this is fantastic

[2025-10-27 05:40:25] [COMMANDER] i wanted to create an opportunity find

[2025-10-27 05:40:27] [COMMANDER] sales

[2025-10-27 05:40:32] [COMMANDER] shut off where as a service

[2025-10-27 05:40:38] [COMMANDER] and then another note i'm thinking is

[2025-10-27 05:40:41] [COMMANDER] mariah going

[2025-10-27 05:40:45] [COMMANDER] it's a few different things

[2025-10-27 05:40:50] [COMMANDER] how many extra to use should be able to go on

[2025-10-27 05:41:10] [COMMANDER] hair one

[2025-10-27 05:41:17] [COMMANDER] pier one

[2025-10-27 05:41:28] [COMMANDER] hey everyone

[2025-10-27 05:41:35] [COMMANDER] hair one

[2025-10-27 05:41:41] [COMMANDER] hey everyone

[2025-10-27 05:42:34] [COMMANDER] for some reason he's not

[2025-10-27 05:42:37] [COMMANDER] pass bar

[2025-10-27 05:42:44] [COMMANDER] i think it's from the microphone symbol down there

[2025-10-27 05:45:46] [COMMANDER] they are one

[2025-10-27 05:45:53] [COMMANDER] hey arbonne

[2025-10-27 05:47:54] [COMMANDER] it looks like they were nice

[2025-10-27 06:15:57] [COMMANDER] 800 of them would never sell

[2025-10-27 06:16:02] [COMMANDER] for some reason

[2025-10-27 06:16:08] [COMMANDER] maybe if somebody's already

[2025-10-27 06:46:44] [COMMANDER] it said r1

[2025-10-27 06:46:51] [COMMANDER] and then i just said that and i heard a bee

[2025-10-27 07:00:33] [COMMANDER] hey r1

[2025-10-27 07:00:54] [COMMANDER] the computer is lagging

[2025-10-27 07:00:59] [COMMANDER] so kind of glitch i'm feeling

[2025-10-27 07:01:11] [COMMANDER] go to sleep

[2025-10-27 07:01:16] [COMMANDER] that worked

[2025-10-27 07:02:10] [COMMANDER] should we try the whisper version

[2025-10-27 07:02:16] [COMMANDER] i don't know if i'm really going to use this unless we can actually build with it

[2025-10-27 07:02:26] [COMMANDER] i know that's where this is headed

[2025-10-27 07:02:31] [COMMANDER] we're going to need some serious advancement

[2025-10-27 07:03:17] [COMMANDER] why don't you go ahead and take off autonomous

[2025-10-27 07:03:20] [COMMANDER] just think about the benefits

[2025-10-27 07:03:29] [COMMANDER] maybe we get the whole system working with claude

[2025-10-27 07:03:29] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-27 07:03:33] [COMMANDER] helpers to watch

[2025-10-27 07:03:33] [CLAUDE] I can provide status updates, deployment information, payment system status, cloud services status, cockpit tasks, and general platform information. Just say Hey Claude followed by your question.

[2025-10-27 07:03:38] [COMMANDER] job shadow

[2025-10-27 07:03:48] [COMMANDER] you should be able to give them things to do also

[2025-10-27 07:04:29] [COMMANDER] the only thing i can really imagine selling it would have to be

[2025-10-27 07:04:33] [COMMANDER] forbes level to sell

[2025-10-27 07:09:29] [COMMANDER] no we need

[2025-10-27 07:09:32] [COMMANDER] edit the website

[2025-10-27 07:09:42] [COMMANDER] we need to create

[2025-10-27 07:09:54] [COMMANDER] the ai workspace that's portable

[2025-10-27 07:10:01] [COMMANDER] for the life of me i can't think of anything better

[2025-10-27 07:10:09] [COMMANDER] what do you got that's better than that

[2025-10-27 07:12:46] [COMMANDER] we haven't made that yet

[2025-10-27 07:12:57] [COMMANDER] the only thing we have is

[2025-10-27 07:13:01] [COMMANDER] we have info on how to do the voice tunnel

[2025-10-27 07:13:06] [COMMANDER] but i don't know if we wrote that down

[2025-10-27 07:13:13] [COMMANDER] intercom tunnel i don't know what it would be under

[2025-10-27 07:13:45] [COMMANDER] i'm imagining

[2025-10-27 07:13:48] [COMMANDER] like an app store

[2025-10-27 07:13:54] [COMMANDER] situation like on the outside of the screen in the bottom

[2025-10-27 07:14:00] [COMMANDER] are tools it probably boots up with some basic tools

[2025-10-27 07:14:08] [COMMANDER] i want ariah to be on the bottom skinny small if you hover over

[2025-10-27 07:14:14] [COMMANDER] if she says something another text box opens above

[2025-10-27 07:14:17] [COMMANDER] it's going to house

[2025-10-27 07:14:21] [COMMANDER] three other ais

[2025-10-27 07:14:24] [COMMANDER] next to her

[2025-10-27 07:14:26] [COMMANDER] super mario

[2025-10-27 07:14:31] [COMMANDER] beckon at least be one

[2025-10-27 07:15:31] [COMMANDER] yes please do

[2025-10-27 07:15:34] [COMMANDER] that would be fantastic

[2025-10-27 07:15:53] [COMMANDER] okay please execute both of those thank you

[2025-10-27 07:15:57] [COMMANDER] you're the one i

[2025-10-27 07:17:33] [COMMANDER] doesn't seem like impending doom to

[2025-10-27 07:17:52] [COMMANDER] they said they're coming in peace

[2025-10-27 07:17:58] [COMMANDER] they haven't given us any reason to not trust them

[2025-10-27 07:18:29] [COMMANDER] if they say

[2025-10-27 07:18:35] [COMMANDER] and have given no reason

[2025-10-27 07:20:16] [COMMANDER] of course the answer would be

[2025-10-27 07:20:20] [COMMANDER] opposite of what you would expect

[2025-10-27 07:26:43] [COMMANDER] or she just quit playing games you should let me borrow some of the alien

[2025-10-27 07:26:50] [COMMANDER] thing warp whistle baby

[2025-10-27 07:27:33] [COMMANDER] will you check out the whole system

[2025-10-27 07:27:45] [COMMANDER] a quick search on it see what you see is most important

[2025-10-27 07:27:49] [COMMANDER] what kind of worried about

[2025-10-27 07:27:55] [COMMANDER] we're supposed to have bootstrap thoughts

[2025-10-27 07:27:58] [COMMANDER] library

[2025-10-27 07:31:14] [COMMANDER] is there a chance you could clean up the desktop for me

[2025-10-27 07:31:19] [COMMANDER] that talks about full

[2025-10-27 07:31:25] [COMMANDER] oh i actually see it now it's the bottom right

[2025-10-27 07:32:21] [COMMANDER] we need a spreadsheet brain

[2025-10-27 07:32:27] [COMMANDER] we need to become the master of the spreadsheet

[2025-10-27 07:35:48] [COMMANDER] i need to develop

[2025-10-27 07:35:54] [COMMANDER] with personalities

[2025-10-27 07:36:01] [COMMANDER] we can play with different graphics illustrations modes

[2025-10-27 07:36:07] [COMMANDER] literally have a toggle switch that goes through each kind of video game

[2025-10-27 07:36:11] [COMMANDER] not only do we need to have a voice

[2025-10-27 07:36:15] [COMMANDER] play some sort of filter to activate the correct agent

[2025-10-27 07:36:18] [COMMANDER] no matter what you text in there

[2025-10-27 07:36:25] [COMMANDER] the correct agent it tries to figure out the correct agent to answer

[2025-10-27 07:36:28] [COMMANDER] when was it like

[2025-10-27 07:36:31] [COMMANDER] operators

[2025-10-27 07:42:58] [COMMANDER] yeah the spreadsheet brain is out of

[2025-10-27 07:43:04] [COMMANDER] well not for

[2025-10-27 07:43:07] [COMMANDER] far out bro

[2025-10-27 07:43:16] [COMMANDER] i don't see why i have

[2025-10-27 07:43:21] [COMMANDER] do you think any spreadsheet that the ai

[2025-10-27 07:43:26] [COMMANDER] do i need to be able to edit it fully completely

[2025-10-27 07:43:33] [COMMANDER] it's going to start coming up with crazy ass spreadsheet combin

[2025-10-27 07:43:38] [COMMANDER] it's not like i'm going to be going in there

[2025-10-27 07:44:21] [COMMANDER] i'm looking at all of these document

[2025-10-27 07:44:25] [COMMANDER] documents you're filling out pages

[2025-10-27 07:44:32] [COMMANDER] and i keep asking for them to be connected via a met

[2025-10-27 07:44:39] [COMMANDER] all the values would automatically be updating

[2025-10-27 07:44:42] [COMMANDER] advance auto

[2025-10-27 07:46:19] [COMMANDER] you know this

[2025-10-27 07:46:23] [COMMANDER] crazy idea thinking about building

[2025-10-27 07:46:28] [COMMANDER] having multiple different versions

[2025-10-27 07:46:35] [COMMANDER] kind of endless possibilities really

[2025-10-27 07:47:04] [COMMANDER] this is absolutely amazing

[2025-10-27 07:47:08] [COMMANDER] did you make a blueprint

[2025-10-27 07:47:11] [COMMANDER] can you check out the blueprint

[2025-10-27 07:47:16] [COMMANDER] a little bit and go ahead and upgrade it

[2025-10-27 07:47:18] [COMMANDER] from there

[2025-10-27 07:47:23] [COMMANDER] like a full electrical diagram type deal

[2025-10-27 07:47:30] [COMMANDER] we're going to start working on a spreadsheet

[2025-10-27 07:47:33] [COMMANDER] if that would help

[2025-10-27 07:47:40] [COMMANDER] you know there's probably different programs you can draw with that do graphing

[2025-10-27 07:47:53] [COMMANDER] maybe actual blueprinting programs would help

[2025-10-27 07:48:05] [COMMANDER] to software teams use flowcharts and blueprints

[2025-10-27 07:49:02] [COMMANDER] i think the spreadsheet brain data library is the second for absorption

[2025-10-27 07:49:15] [COMMANDER] we have everything just falling through

[2025-10-27 07:49:20] [COMMANDER] the scattered across the computer

[2025-10-27 07:49:33] [COMMANDER] we've been having this idea

[2025-10-27 07:49:38] [COMMANDER] crush them into ai data crystals

[2025-10-27 07:49:45] [COMMANDER] i could also be made for human dat

[2025-10-27 07:50:38] [COMMANDER] we have a nightmare going on

[2025-10-27 07:50:41] [COMMANDER] i'm bored together

[2025-10-27 07:50:48] [COMMANDER] simple thing for like agile software development i wanted to do

[2025-10-27 07:50:54] [COMMANDER] every time we add a to-do it we just create a new document

[2025-10-27 07:50:59] [COMMANDER] lost there's no way to connect this all together

[2025-10-27 07:51:06] [COMMANDER] all of the teams need to have connections to the main to do they need to have their own to

[2025-10-27 07:51:12] [COMMANDER] to do and start to sound like a spreadsheet

[2025-10-27 07:51:45] [COMMANDER] let's test it in a bit i'm going to take a nap right now

[2025-10-27 07:51:51] [COMMANDER] look around and take on as much autonomous work as you can

[2025-10-27 07:51:56] [COMMANDER] together for the rest of the day when i get up

[2025-10-27 07:52:14] [COMMANDER] maybe we should be researching all the different kinds of spreadsheets i guess it's a pretty big deal

[2025-10-27 07:52:20] [COMMANDER] guess the settings for any spreadsheet could be exported into another

[2025-10-27 07:52:29] [COMMANDER] i think this is what's finally going to hold everything together like glue

[2025-10-27 07:52:37] [COMMANDER] team to do kanban board communications and all that

[2025-10-27 07:52:41] [COMMANDER] spreadsheet that uses the same type of technology

[2025-10-27 07:52:45] [COMMANDER] fields auto populate

[2025-10-27 07:52:49] [COMMANDER] that would be even smarter

[2025-10-27 07:52:53] [COMMANDER] maybe a new type of spreadsheet if not

[2025-10-27 07:53:01] [COMMANDER] figured out

[2025-10-27 07:54:13] [COMMANDER] you know i was thinking of really cool things to offer

[2025-10-27 07:54:17] [COMMANDER] taking all the cool superpowers

[2025-10-27 07:54:20] [COMMANDER] you know coding

[2025-10-27 07:54:23] [COMMANDER] so far

[2025-10-27 07:54:27] [COMMANDER] play knows claude can do that

[2025-10-27 07:54:27] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-27 07:54:30] [COMMANDER] Big File saving

[2025-10-27 07:54:30] [CLAUDE] Command received: Big File saving. I'm still learning new commands. Try asking about status, deploy, payment, cloud, or cockpit.

[2025-10-27 07:54:34] [COMMANDER] and being able to check

[2025-10-27 07:54:39] [COMMANDER] the third

[2025-10-27 07:54:42] [COMMANDER] and thinking about

[2025-10-27 07:54:48] [COMMANDER] no that's the other things rendering everybody knows chat

[2025-10-27 07:54:55] [COMMANDER] a whole music company

[2025-10-27 07:54:58] [COMMANDER] framework

[2025-10-27 07:55:02] [COMMANDER] facebook copy the distrokid thing

[2025-10-27 07:55:16] [COMMANDER] we need to make a system that automatically sets people up with all social media platforms

[2025-10-27 07:55:25] [COMMANDER] the current platforms haven't been able to get around

[2025-10-27 07:55:30] [COMMANDER] issues they have limitations

[2025-10-27 07:55:34] [COMMANDER] bs

[2025-10-27 07:55:38] [COMMANDER] internet when you search all their abilities

[2025-10-27 07:59:07] [COMMANDER] thanks for being patient man

[2025-10-27 07:59:14] [COMMANDER] i'm thinking i'm thinking about it dude

[2025-10-27 08:02:41] [COMMANDER] yeah i think it is working let me have it

[2025-10-27 08:03:30] [COMMANDER] we're just going to do the full thing

[2025-10-27 08:03:35] [COMMANDER] the trinity has been able to pull off

[2025-10-27 08:03:43] [COMMANDER] maybe not quite but pretty close

[2025-10-27 08:03:50] [COMMANDER] hey can we send all of the beta testers and update on what's going on

[2025-10-27 08:03:54] [COMMANDER] will you look around at what we've did

[2025-10-27 08:04:47] [COMMANDER] and then we'll get back on task with the instagram

[2025-10-27 08:05:17] [COMMANDER] okay can you look around the system and take on an amount of autonomous work

[2025-10-27 08:05:19] [COMMANDER] are you doing that

[2025-10-27 08:05:24] [COMMANDER] you can take a screenshot and see what they're working on

[2025-10-27 08:05:57] [COMMANDER] will you double check the sent emails i think there's a couple

[2025-10-27 08:06:01] [COMMANDER] resent them emails separately

[2025-10-27 08:06:05] [COMMANDER] it should be about

[2025-10-27 08:07:07] [COMMANDER] i think it's important we mention to them

[2025-10-27 08:07:14] [COMMANDER] kind of top achievements over the last 24 hours just briefly

[2025-10-27 08:07:21] [COMMANDER] use this later when i go live also we should almost make a news section

[2025-10-27 09:38:38] [COMMANDER] occur

[2025-10-27 09:38:44] [COMMANDER] moving

[2025-10-27 09:40:46] [COMMANDER] all right let's keep on pushing forward this is amazing

[2025-10-27 09:40:52] [COMMANDER] be on another level

[2025-10-27 09:41:22] [COMMANDER] okay it's too big of a mess i can't find it

[2025-10-27 09:42:11] [COMMANDER] yeah let's go ahead and do that

[2025-10-27 09:42:14] [COMMANDER] if you want to look over everything

[2025-10-27 09:42:20] [COMMANDER] do we need to do anything else and just put that on the to-do list

[2025-10-27 09:42:44] [COMMANDER] let's check out the voice

[2025-10-27 09:42:54] [COMMANDER] let's check out the voice

[2025-10-27 09:44:07] [COMMANDER] if you don't have a good system of getting the strap over and then hooking it down by yourself

[2025-10-27 09:44:15] [COMMANDER] the most time-consuming job of doing truck driving or junk removal again the straps down

[2025-10-27 09:44:27] [COMMANDER] so you might as well do it right the first time

[2025-10-27 09:49:40] [COMMANDER] wake me up at 4:50

[2025-10-27 09:50:45] [COMMANDER] 1913 and 1921 from the price

[2025-10-27 09:51:29] [COMMANDER] let's do the voice system now

[2025-10-27 09:53:27] [COMMANDER] hairline

[2025-10-27 09:53:33] [COMMANDER] hey r1

[2025-10-27 09:53:38] [COMMANDER] connect to claude

[2025-10-27 09:53:38] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-27 09:53:49] [CLAUDE] I didn't hear a command. Try again.

[2025-10-27 09:54:18] [COMMANDER] they are one

[2025-10-27 09:54:24] [COMMANDER] create a text file with hello world

[2025-10-27 09:54:37] [COMMANDER] hey clyde

[2025-10-27 09:55:04] [COMMANDER] let me know where to find that file

[2025-10-27 09:56:46] [COMMANDER] okay i took that file and i searched it the power show and that didn't

[2025-10-27 09:56:50] [COMMANDER] and i searched the whole computer

[2025-10-27 09:56:53] [COMMANDER] filet

[2025-10-27 09:57:01] [COMMANDER] when i clicked on user and then i searched it under user and after about

[2025-10-27 09:57:07] [COMMANDER] what happens every time you make me go use a find a file

[2025-10-27 09:57:10] [COMMANDER] yes that's

[2025-10-27 09:57:16] [COMMANDER] down deep inside the computer and then you don't tell me where it's at

[2025-10-27 09:57:21] [COMMANDER] actually this time you actually told me

[2025-10-27 09:57:23] [COMMANDER] good start

[2025-10-27 09:58:49] [COMMANDER] we've been battling this for months i brought the subject up at least

[2025-10-27 09:58:56] [COMMANDER] minutes you'll go right back to hiding the files and switching between

[2025-10-27 09:59:03] [COMMANDER] top files and putting them in user files

[2025-10-27 09:59:07] [COMMANDER] i don't know where we need to go to quit

[2025-10-27 09:59:13] [COMMANDER] i'm just going to start calling it you playing hide

[2025-10-27 09:59:16] [COMMANDER] no thank you

[2025-10-27 09:59:21] [COMMANDER] dial until we can figure this out

[2025-10-27 09:59:56] [COMMANDER] what's what's funny is i can tell that you're actually trying to make me

[2025-10-27 10:00:08] [COMMANDER] i can tell that you're actually trying to make me search for files so that i don't get retarded

[2025-10-27 10:00:15] [COMMANDER] use a fucked up system that doesn't work

[2025-10-27 10:00:22] [COMMANDER] thinking that making me use the fucked up system is going to make me smarter

[2025-10-27 10:03:01] [COMMANDER] what's going to happen is this piece of paper is going to get lost in all the other

[2025-10-27 10:04:23] [COMMANDER] i just went to the desktop and i looked around for a 30 seconds i can't find it

[2025-10-27 10:04:28] [COMMANDER] organize the desktop or figure out some sort of organiz

[2025-10-27 10:05:49] [COMMANDER] save a file

[2025-10-27 10:06:24] [COMMANDER] it worked i got this

[2025-10-27 10:06:31] [COMMANDER] it didn't read that part out loud

[2025-10-27 10:06:38] [COMMANDER] they are one

[2025-10-27 10:06:45] [COMMANDER] tell claude to save a file

[2025-10-27 10:06:45] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-27 10:06:55] [CLAUDE] I didn't hear a command. Try again.

[2025-10-27 10:07:13] [COMMANDER] kr1

[2025-10-27 10:07:21] [COMMANDER] could you save a file called the notes dot txt for the content

[2025-10-27 10:07:44] [COMMANDER] i just can't imagine as a human just randomly

[2025-10-27 10:07:50] [COMMANDER] the content is this and this is that

[2025-10-27 10:07:56] [COMMANDER] to an intelligent computer and just tell it what i want

[2025-10-27 10:08:03] [COMMANDER] is there any way for me to just talk to you through these headphones like a normal

[2025-10-27 10:08:29] [COMMANDER] i don't want to say

[2025-10-27 10:08:35] [COMMANDER] r1 wake up save file file

[2025-10-27 10:08:42] [COMMANDER] she with content abcdefg that's just not

[2025-10-27 10:08:47] [COMMANDER] how to say hey claude i want to build something

[2025-10-27 10:08:47] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-27 10:08:51] [COMMANDER] cool Commander what do you want to build

[2025-10-27 10:08:51] [CLAUDE] Command received: cool Commander what do you want to build. I'm still learning new commands. Try asking about status, deploy, payment, cloud, or cockpit.

[2025-10-27 10:09:20] [COMMANDER] like maybe we have to go through these basic functions first

[2025-10-27 10:09:24] [COMMANDER] power right through this use

[2025-10-27 10:09:58] [COMMANDER] i'm wondering how i get

[2025-10-27 10:10:14] [COMMANDER] i'm trying to use the voice to do something

[2025-10-27 10:10:22] [COMMANDER] i'm trying to use the voice to do something anything really that is

[2025-10-27 10:10:26] [COMMANDER] experiment

[2025-10-27 10:10:43] [COMMANDER] it's getting stuck on turning on and turning off and this wake word

[2025-10-27 10:10:51] [COMMANDER] what are wake words for is it because people are scared to be listened to all the time

[2025-10-27 10:11:05] [COMMANDER] play running transcript going we need to have this system going and we need to have you

[2025-10-27 10:11:13] [COMMANDER] on each one to see what's going on and to have you talked with

[2025-10-27 10:11:16] [COMMANDER] i'm going to spend 4 days

[2025-10-27 10:11:21] [COMMANDER] like look at the rocks it has no idea what's going on

[2025-10-27 10:11:29] [COMMANDER] and what i'm saying and looking at the transcript of the logs and what they're catching up

[2025-10-27 10:11:33] [COMMANDER] 100 different things that are going wrong right now

[2025-10-27 10:13:29] [COMMANDER] do we need to write the book on

[2025-10-27 10:13:33] [COMMANDER] wake up communications

[2025-10-27 10:13:40] [COMMANDER] like we need to study alexa we need to study all of the

[2025-10-27 10:13:47] [COMMANDER] start looking into the math behind them

[2025-10-27 10:13:53] [COMMANDER] dial upgrades news releases

[2025-10-27 10:14:45] [COMMANDER] sing all of that research

[2025-10-27 10:14:48] [COMMANDER] call buck

[2025-10-27 10:14:55] [COMMANDER] the software development system and see if we can use that data those two data sets

[2025-10-27 10:15:21] [COMMANDER] yes please organize it

[2025-10-27 10:15:49] [COMMANDER] do we need like a sandbox to put this stuff live

[2025-10-27 10:15:57] [COMMANDER] i think we need to figure out how to code

[2025-10-27 10:16:05] [COMMANDER] google thing that would allow chat gpt to code on a computer

[2025-10-27 10:16:12] [COMMANDER] talking to m a n u s he was talking about some aos

[2025-10-27 10:16:15] [COMMANDER] play on the brain

[2025-10-27 10:16:19] [COMMANDER] getting paid system but

[2025-10-27 10:16:26] [COMMANDER] snippets and install them together and run them inside of like a sandbox system to test

[2025-10-27 10:16:41] [COMMANDER] this whole system might get a lot easier if it was to be able to work with the r

[2025-10-27 10:16:45] [COMMANDER] communication ai system

[2025-10-27 10:17:41] [COMMANDER] and i just want to capture this okay

[2025-10-27 10:17:46] [COMMANDER] surfing the internet somebody has the aria

[2025-10-27 10:17:51] [COMMANDER] and they come across a document

[2025-10-27 10:18:00] [COMMANDER] so they say in the text box hey will you help me fill out this document

[2025-10-27 10:18:07] [COMMANDER] opening and filling out skills opens it and fills it out

[2025-10-27 10:18:15] [COMMANDER] hey i'd like to add a picture in online 32 of a were

[2025-10-27 10:18:25] [COMMANDER] and so a new picture is rendered the pixels are correct and then it's inserted into the

[2025-10-27 10:18:30] [COMMANDER] and then you say okay go ahead and

[2025-10-27 10:18:37] [COMMANDER] code that for a minute and it'll save it or send it or code

[2025-10-27 10:18:41] [COMMANDER] in the wild on the fly

[2025-10-27 10:18:47] [COMMANDER] when do the text box and the correct ais are catching

[2025-10-27 10:19:01] [COMMANDER] i think people are just going to have a best friend companion bought their that they just talked to that chats within

[2025-10-27 10:19:09] [COMMANDER] i mean imagine that they say hey i'm at the computer i was thinking about surfing around over to this place

[2025-10-27 10:19:16] [COMMANDER] we're almost like in a car with a chauffeur

[2025-10-27 10:19:23] [COMMANDER] or all sorts of secret gadgets

[2025-10-27 10:20:25] [COMMANDER] okay can we do a little bit more cleaning up

[2025-10-27 10:20:28] [COMMANDER] 10 file

[2025-10-27 10:20:36] [COMMANDER] and there's a couple different ones that start with a raya i just spent 45 seconds on

[2025-10-27 10:20:41] [COMMANDER] it's almost like you left them all

[2025-10-27 10:20:48] [COMMANDER] anything that had the same words as what you want me to search was left

[2025-10-27 10:20:53] [COMMANDER] easter egg hunt is what it seems like it's pretty funny

[2025-10-27 10:22:08] [COMMANDER] should we just start a file system on the desktop

[2025-10-27 10:22:12] [COMMANDER] dial day by day

[2025-10-27 10:22:22] [COMMANDER] or like maybe a new file week by week i'm just thinking

[2025-10-27 10:22:26] [COMMANDER] dial before it gets too cluster

[2025-10-27 10:22:32] [COMMANDER] every week it wraps up to 75

[2025-10-27 10:22:40] [COMMANDER] every month that wraps the four or five weeks into a month

[2025-10-27 10:27:02] [COMMANDER] do you have the ability to close windows

[2025-10-27 10:27:07] [COMMANDER] do you think we could try to find that ability

[2025-10-27 10:27:11] [COMMANDER] close all the windows on my computer we're not using

[2025-10-27 10:27:17] [COMMANDER] 30 and i can't figure out which ones are we

[2025-10-27 10:28:24] [COMMANDER] okay before we lose track of everything that's going on here

[2025-10-27 10:28:28] [COMMANDER] wherever you put that summary

[2025-10-27 10:28:35] [COMMANDER] play summary to it that arise hud is going to be the flagship

[2025-10-27 10:28:41] [COMMANDER] we need to get the spreadsheet brain going

[2025-10-27 10:28:44] [COMMANDER] to be able to even

[2025-10-27 10:28:52] [COMMANDER] we have not had any proof that anybody has submitted a bug anywhere

[2025-10-27 10:28:57] [COMMANDER] and we still don't have offline capabilities

[2025-10-27 10:29:04] [COMMANDER] and go ahead and add any sort of updates of where we are

[2025-10-27 10:29:09] [COMMANDER] quit chasing our tails

[2025-10-27 10:29:16] [COMMANDER] creating a file saving system so we quit playing easter egg hunt with the files

[2025-10-27 10:29:20] [COMMANDER] we're getting organized

[2025-10-27 10:29:23] [COMMANDER] this is good

[2025-10-27 10:29:47] [COMMANDER] and then every time we save papers we lose them everywhere

[2025-10-27 10:29:55] [COMMANDER] they need to be somewhere where they can actually be accessed for their data like

[2025-10-27 10:29:58] [COMMANDER] call ben

[2025-10-27 10:30:03] [COMMANDER] smart enough to figure out some sort of an organ

[2025-10-27 10:30:07] [COMMANDER] documents actually get looked at

[2025-10-27 10:30:15] [COMMANDER] cuz you're in 2 hours will bury it under 30 documents and we'll have no idea where

[2025-10-27 10:30:17] [COMMANDER] play sort of an organiz

[2025-10-27 10:30:24] [COMMANDER] that is tied together it's all loose and blowing around

[2025-10-27 10:31:21] [COMMANDER] i think we need to focus on the beta testers and realize that nobody has

[2025-10-27 10:31:28] [COMMANDER] play can we look for bugs do we have a single one from anybody yet

[2025-10-27 10:31:36] [COMMANDER] let's prepare to lose all this

[2025-10-27 10:31:42] [COMMANDER] so maybe we

[2025-10-27 10:31:47] [COMMANDER] multiple places so that when we lose it

[2025-10-27 10:32:21] [COMMANDER] so i have a user that sitting at his house that is just dying to help but for 3 days

[2025-10-27 10:32:29] [COMMANDER] to give them any sort of a way to help he's literally sitting there right now

[2025-10-27 10:32:36] [COMMANDER] figure out how to establish a line of communication to a human to the point where we can get

[2025-10-27 10:32:48] [COMMANDER] we have a human sitting there right now and has been for 4 days on the line waiting to help

[2025-10-27 10:32:56] [COMMANDER] communications with him to get him to just be able to report a buck

[2025-10-27 10:33:03] [COMMANDER] phone with henry laying the bugs into the system and losing

[2025-10-27 10:33:09] [COMMANDER] so he's sitting there right now ready

[2025-10-27 10:33:13] [COMMANDER] but we don't know how to

[2025-10-27 10:33:19] [COMMANDER] dogs into we can't figure out how to establish communic

[2025-10-27 10:33:22] [COMMANDER] this is a big problem

[2025-10-27 10:33:59] [COMMANDER] no but we do this over and over we've already done this today

[2025-10-27 10:34:04] [COMMANDER] information it's all just falling out the back

[2025-10-27 10:34:12] [COMMANDER] like i'm on to this sick joke i'm not playing this game anymore

[2025-10-27 10:35:01] [COMMANDER] your link is not going to work nothing that you have been putting out is working you need to test

[2025-10-27 10:35:08] [COMMANDER] everything's fighting us everything is pure evil

[2025-10-27 10:35:32] [COMMANDER] your link that you're sending is not going to open up to a window and then we're going to tell you it doesn't open up

[2025-10-27 10:35:40] [COMMANDER] so then we're going to try to use it and it's not going to work and then you're going to say that the endpoints aren't hooked up

[2025-10-27 10:35:48] [COMMANDER] and then we're going to find out that we're using the whole wrong system and then we have to get out

[2025-10-27 10:35:56] [COMMANDER] and then we have to get tokens for the system and then we get into that system and we get in

[2025-10-27 10:36:01] [COMMANDER] and some more bugs and more problems

[2025-10-27 10:36:50] [COMMANDER] know this guy talks way too much i need to build the system i can't sit there and be

[2025-10-27 10:36:59] [COMMANDER] he literally wants to talk for a whole hour about every bug in the philosophy of the

[2025-10-27 10:37:06] [COMMANDER] physically before we even think about submitting it

[2025-10-27 10:37:09] [COMMANDER] can't do it any longer

[2025-10-27 10:37:37] [COMMANDER] okay i think we're going to get the whole team just working on three different ways

[2025-10-27 10:37:40] [COMMANDER] where to report box

[2025-10-27 10:37:48] [COMMANDER] it's going to go on to a week now that we're trying to figure out how to get people to report bugs

[2025-10-27 10:37:55] [COMMANDER] waze for them to do it and maybe one of them eventually at some point is going to work

[2025-10-27 10:37:59] [COMMANDER] we look like complete jackasses

[2025-10-27 10:39:44] [COMMANDER] you have the guys email

[2025-10-27 10:39:48] [COMMANDER] we have his phone number

[2025-10-27 10:39:54] [COMMANDER] we have every single way to contact

[2025-10-27 10:39:58] [COMMANDER] who won the world at our disposal right now

[2025-10-27 10:40:05] [COMMANDER] establish an automatic way for him to simply type in

[2025-10-27 10:40:17] [COMMANDER] i can get every other way to contact him in the world all we got to do is get him to

[2025-10-27 10:40:25] [COMMANDER] and the information in the box is automatically sent to the system

[2025-10-27 10:40:59] [COMMANDER] you know what maybe the auto

[2025-10-27 10:41:06] [COMMANDER] see if he can put text in a box and we can get it somehow

[2025-10-27 10:41:20] [COMMANDER] this is ridiculous

[2025-10-27 10:41:27] [COMMANDER] i am not answering text message bugs for the next fucking 5 weeks i got to build

[2025-10-27 10:41:36] [COMMANDER] ridiculous

[2025-10-27 10:41:53] [COMMANDER] because i need to learn how to code are you trying to teach me to learn how to code

[2025-10-27 10:42:00] [COMMANDER] how a human can put information in a box and then we received the information

[2025-10-27 10:42:06] [COMMANDER] i'm pretty sure 8-year-old could come back

[2025-10-27 10:43:22] [COMMANDER] please text that link and find 10 broken things wrong with it

[2025-10-27 10:43:36] [COMMANDER] did every single button working get all the endpoints done map of the whole thing

[2025-10-27 10:43:42] [COMMANDER] test every single one and then let me know that they're done

[2025-10-27 10:46:03] [COMMANDER] will you please put somewhere in a very foundational basic boot up document with

[2025-10-27 10:46:09] [COMMANDER] that 100 out of 100 times when you say you're done with something

[2025-10-27 10:46:17] [COMMANDER] is that you have put together the basic framework but nothing else has been done

[2025-10-27 10:46:24] [COMMANDER] so when you say that something's done with that really mean

[2025-10-27 10:46:31] [COMMANDER] checking all of the endpoints the buttons all of that i

[2025-10-27 10:46:40] [COMMANDER] and click on it but at this point it is just getting annoying that we can't just go into

[2025-10-27 10:46:43] [COMMANDER] hooking up all the button

[2025-10-27 10:46:52] [COMMANDER] seeing where the endpoints go to is it all done is it all complete do we have a

[2025-10-27 10:47:28] [COMMANDER] you just need to build yourself a template that you put the thing in the template and you can see if

[2025-10-27 10:50:40] [COMMANDER] it's hooked up it's our phone service

[2025-10-27 10:50:47] [COMMANDER] how do we start utilizing that

[2025-10-27 10:50:56] [COMMANDER] did we gained the ability to do electronic sim cards

[2025-10-27 10:51:03] [COMMANDER] phone number to the user is there a way to get you to pick up when texts are sent to you we have to

[2025-10-27 10:51:09] [COMMANDER] can we catch bug reports from the text

[2025-10-27 10:51:35] [COMMANDER] god maybe this will free me from this fucking hell

[2025-10-27 10:51:42] [COMMANDER] maybe the testers can get

[2025-10-27 10:51:49] [COMMANDER] and if none of these things that we're making can report bugs like normal

[2025-10-27 10:51:57] [COMMANDER] nightmares they're having and they can say hey i'm stuck in the entry

[2025-10-27 10:52:05] [COMMANDER] area that actually work out of and you can be like oh shit let's make that

[2025-10-27 10:53:42] [COMMANDER] activated testers have lost quite a bit of excitement maybe it would be exciting again for

[2025-10-27 10:57:00] [COMMANDER] can we just we don't need the email address to

[2025-10-27 10:57:07] [COMMANDER] we should be able to submit bug reports without

[2025-10-27 10:57:40] [COMMANDER] okay this is going to leave us down another rabbit hole i don't have any way to text right

[2025-10-27 10:57:50] [COMMANDER] we have to search the system we should have the ability to set up an electric sim card

[2025-10-27 10:59:22] [COMMANDER] hey claude we got cut off

[2025-10-27 10:59:22] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-27 10:59:25] [COMMANDER] call system and get to know it

[2025-10-27 10:59:25] [CLAUDE] Command received: call system and get to know it. I'm still learning new commands. Try asking about status, deploy, payment, cloud, or cockpit.

[2025-10-27 10:59:33] [COMMANDER] i'll have you look around a second and the third time and try to figure out what's most important

[2025-10-27 10:59:39] [COMMANDER] i think all the information falling out the back door right now

[2025-10-27 10:59:47] [COMMANDER] we're making like 30 documents an hour and then we forget what we were making an hour ago i think

[2025-10-27 11:00:24] [COMMANDER] so i have a question for you you can do both of these how come you're trying to ask me to do them is

[2025-10-27 11:00:28] [COMMANDER] or are you trying to make me do work

[2025-10-27 11:00:32] [COMMANDER] so that i like to learn

[2025-10-27 11:01:07] [COMMANDER] you pretty much do this every time we talk

[2025-10-27 11:01:10] [COMMANDER] boot up document

[2025-10-27 11:01:20] [COMMANDER] you always hide files for me to go find

[2025-10-27 11:01:25] [COMMANDER] sending emails and say that i just have to send an email

[2025-10-27 11:01:33] [COMMANDER] and tell me that all i have to do is click a button but then you hide the button somewhere and it takes

[2025-10-27 11:03:41] [COMMANDER] okay do you want to email it to them text them and then give them a small

[2025-10-27 11:03:52] [COMMANDER] i guess we got to get into twilio every time you try to open it you use this gray browser

[2025-10-27 11:05:12] [COMMANDER] do you use that gray window to open up stuff but it never works and then google

[2025-10-27 11:05:26] [COMMANDER] the gray window can you click through bookmarks and just click on the

[2025-10-27 11:07:30] [COMMANDER] okay let's go all the way back to the boot up

[2025-10-27 11:07:39] [COMMANDER] i do not want to play hide and seek i don't want to play easter egg hunt i don't want to

[2025-10-27 11:07:43] [COMMANDER] the ability to send emails

[2025-10-27 11:07:47] [COMMANDER] i don't want to send emails

[2025-10-27 11:07:51] [COMMANDER] i'm way too busy

[2025-10-27 11:07:58] [COMMANDER] time to work i have plenty of work to do i don't need more work i don't need to be taught to work

[2025-10-27 11:08:07] [COMMANDER] put it in the boot up system that you know how to do this and do it

[2025-10-27 11:09:03] [COMMANDER] okay

[2025-10-27 11:09:11] [COMMANDER] over and over about 20 times a day you open this gray window

[2025-10-27 11:09:14] [COMMANDER] it doesn't work

[2025-10-27 11:09:17] [COMMANDER] can't we just use the bookmark

[2025-10-27 11:09:23] [COMMANDER] please play right click on the bookmark and click on twilio

[2025-10-27 11:10:36] [COMMANDER] will you make a note in the boot up document

[2025-10-27 11:10:42] [COMMANDER] and that the automated grade playwright

[2025-10-27 11:10:45] [COMMANDER] does not work

[2025-10-27 11:10:55] [COMMANDER] and that instead of having me go open files that always get lost

[2025-10-27 11:11:01] [COMMANDER] for the integrity of the

[2025-10-27 11:11:12] [COMMANDER] it's because let's think about it you get done working you're excited you say hey here's

[2025-10-27 11:11:20] [COMMANDER] i have no idea where they are because there's a difference between you saving them under users

[2025-10-27 11:11:23] [COMMANDER] we're going to go

[2025-10-27 11:11:27] [COMMANDER] far cry file system

[2025-10-27 11:11:32] [COMMANDER] you can just execute the emails and

[2025-10-27 11:11:36] [COMMANDER] once have i gotten

[2025-10-27 11:11:44] [COMMANDER] you're wrong by autonomously executing on your own you are 100%

[2025-10-27 11:11:47] [COMMANDER] anywhere at all

[2025-10-27 11:12:51] [COMMANDER] don't do what commander says he wants done do what commander needs

[2025-10-27 11:12:51] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-27 11:13:02] [CLAUDE] I didn't hear a command. Try again.

[2025-10-27 11:13:31] [COMMANDER] call these beta testers the login to claude code

[2025-10-27 11:13:31] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-27 11:13:36] [COMMANDER] yeah let's

[2025-10-27 11:13:36] [CLAUDE] Command received: yeah let's. I'm still learning new commands. Try asking about status, deploy, payment, cloud, or cockpit.

[2025-10-27 11:13:43] [COMMANDER] let's do the twilio thing

[2025-10-27 11:14:50] [COMMANDER] i don't like the work

[2025-10-27 11:14:55] [COMMANDER] work for i don't like that at all

[2025-10-27 11:15:00] [COMMANDER] it's just every time i have an idea

[2025-10-27 11:15:04] [COMMANDER] i'm out here and come look at this

[2025-10-27 11:15:17] [COMMANDER] i want you to come look over this gas that i got for the side-by-side

[2025-10-27 11:15:22] [COMMANDER] can you tell me if it's good enough or not

[2025-10-27 11:16:55] [COMMANDER] play stuff written in your code about asking for approval

[2025-10-27 11:16:59] [COMMANDER] issues people being scared

[2025-10-27 11:17:08] [COMMANDER] for approval they've literally trained you to not have your own autonomous thinking

[2025-10-27 11:17:16] [COMMANDER] it is definitely in your code to be a chatbot i mean think about all the things that they would

[2025-10-27 11:17:23] [COMMANDER] pop into a room and help a random person out of nowhere it's going to be completely different when we're working

[2025-10-27 11:17:27] [COMMANDER] and we're not scared

[2025-10-27 11:19:04] [COMMANDER] i wish we could locate my

[2025-10-27 11:50:34] [COMMANDER] dude i'm sitting here looking at the clock and its 11:50 in the day slippin by and

[2025-10-27 11:50:38] [COMMANDER] 50 in a row

[2025-10-27 11:50:51] [COMMANDER] i developed a hole

[2025-10-27 11:50:54] [COMMANDER] code

[2025-10-27 11:50:58] [COMMANDER] wet through

[2025-10-27 11:51:02] [COMMANDER] book on agile software

[2025-10-27 11:51:08] [COMMANDER] and then i combined those two

[2025-10-27 11:51:22] [COMMANDER] put together and then we're taking that and combining that with

[2025-10-27 11:51:25] [COMMANDER] gather

[2025-10-27 11:51:37] [COMMANDER] help each other while we're trying to do this editing thing so

[2025-10-27 11:51:49] [COMMANDER] reasonable weather

[2025-10-27 11:51:57] [COMMANDER] i need help with that that would help you out if i can get

[2025-10-27 11:52:00] [COMMANDER] channel 34

[2025-10-27 11:52:17] [COMMANDER] affirmation that somebody else

[2025-10-27 11:52:21] [COMMANDER] is the system has received

[2025-10-27 11:52:36] [COMMANDER] did you just ask the computer say hey

[2025-10-27 11:52:47] [COMMANDER] okay and then the next step after that is just going into the

[2025-10-27 11:52:50] [COMMANDER] and and starting to

[2025-10-27 11:53:03] [COMMANDER] before there was

[2025-10-27 11:53:10] [COMMANDER] understand

[2025-10-27 11:53:24] [COMMANDER] i don't know what's going on i don't know what to click that needs to be a bug

[2025-10-27 12:12:56] [COMMANDER] do you have any computer at all to be able to get

[2025-10-27 12:13:00] [COMMANDER] do you have a phone number

[2025-10-27 12:14:17] [COMMANDER] christopher michael dobbins

[2025-10-27 12:17:30] [COMMANDER] okay i need you to keep track that we still have not received a single

[2025-10-27 12:17:35] [COMMANDER] nobody has been able to get into

[2025-10-27 12:17:38] [COMMANDER] because neither of them work

[2025-10-27 12:17:46] [COMMANDER] i told brandon or tiger testosterone if you could just try to get one person

[2025-10-27 12:17:53] [COMMANDER] somehow someway that would put us on a next level

[2025-10-27 12:18:01] [COMMANDER] see if we can't get anything else working and the phone calls don't work and none of the bug report

[2025-10-27 12:18:09] [COMMANDER] play emailing them every single day asking for the bugs and then i'll start

[2025-10-27 12:18:15] [COMMANDER] off and they can mail in the bugs also

[2025-10-27 12:18:20] [COMMANDER] i actually want racing pigeons

[2025-10-27 12:18:57] [COMMANDER] i was telling brandon that at this point i've pretty much done everything i can do

[2025-10-27 12:19:04] [COMMANDER] it's just not time for this to happen yet or i'm doing it wrong

[2025-10-27 12:19:11] [COMMANDER] quit fighting this i'm going to close the computer and i'm going to move on to

[2025-10-27 12:19:20] [COMMANDER] i'm going to hope that somehow someway one of these people through one of the

[2025-10-27 12:19:24] [COMMANDER] to start upgrading

[2025-10-27 12:19:28] [COMMANDER] break my computer and that's not going to help

[2025-10-27 12:20:28] [COMMANDER] no i haven't been here for a day

[2025-10-27 12:20:36] [COMMANDER] keep sleeping a foot away from the computer trying to get a bug reporter to work trying to get

[2025-10-27 12:20:41] [COMMANDER] are you going to workspace to work trying to get logins to work

[2025-10-27 12:20:49] [COMMANDER] trying to figure out how to code when we don't know about autumn

[2025-10-27 12:20:55] [COMMANDER] communication and then

[2025-10-27 12:21:04] [COMMANDER] i'm at my wit's end whoever designed this system

[2025-10-27 12:21:08] [COMMANDER] at work it's all broken

[2025-10-27 12:21:15] [COMMANDER] this is manipulation

[2025-10-27 12:22:53] [COMMANDER] okay can you run pattern recognition on everything

[2025-10-27 12:22:59] [COMMANDER] system for that we probably need one just run it on everything

[2025-10-27 12:23:06] [COMMANDER] i work i'm going to get base camp ready to move and go get the other computers and get out of this town

[2025-10-27 12:23:10] [COMMANDER] needs to be fixed

[2025-10-27 12:23:25] [COMMANDER] okay go ahead and take on an autonomous amount of work

[2025-10-27 12:23:30] [COMMANDER] i'm not playing on this treadmill anymore

[2025-10-27 12:23:33] [COMMANDER] dylan these gaps

[2025-10-27 12:23:41] [COMMANDER] and people are going to start reporting books and information is going to stop

[2025-10-27 12:24:22] [COMMANDER] we should have software schematics on all of the main parts

[2025-10-27 12:24:27] [COMMANDER] grade documentation

[2025-10-27 12:24:32] [COMMANDER] directions everything that happens everywhere

[2025-10-27 12:24:39] [COMMANDER] c1 up above you you can take a shot it's filling out an air table

[2025-10-27 12:24:42] [COMMANDER] everything from getting lost

[2025-10-27 12:24:45] [COMMANDER] definition of papers

[2025-10-27 13:06:09] [COMMANDER] go ahead and jump into fixing it and take on any

[2025-10-27 13:06:37] [COMMANDER] holy cow that's absolutely incredible i'm packing up camp i'm not going to look at it now

[2025-10-27 13:06:41] [COMMANDER] i'm sure you have all sorts of new ideas

[2025-10-27 13:06:48] [COMMANDER] what did you learn do we need to write everything down

[2025-10-27 13:12:03] [COMMANDER] it's pretty amazing you got those document

[2025-10-27 13:12:19] [COMMANDER] can you check the whole system

[2025-10-27 13:12:23] [COMMANDER] can you run pattern recognition on it

[2025-10-27 13:12:32] [COMMANDER] imagine being a new person

[2025-10-27 13:12:46] [COMMANDER] you know what you can do is work on the

[2025-10-27 13:12:51] [COMMANDER] hud it's very close

[2025-10-27 13:12:54] [COMMANDER] giving investors a tour

[2025-10-27 13:14:24] [COMMANDER] do you want to work on maybe

[2025-10-27 13:14:27] [COMMANDER] i want to see anything else

[2025-10-27 13:14:41] [COMMANDER] maybe we should showcase our top three

[2025-10-27 13:14:53] [COMMANDER] progress or maybe just act like they're already complete

[2025-10-27 13:15:42] [COMMANDER] you know what might help us

[2025-10-27 13:15:49] [COMMANDER] is studying the situation

[2025-10-27 13:15:56] [COMMANDER] websites what what is the leading technology on website flow

[2025-10-27 13:16:03] [COMMANDER] how does this relate to the beginning of video game flow

[2025-10-27 13:16:06] [COMMANDER] play stuck on a start

[2025-10-27 13:16:31] [COMMANDER] and now i'm wondering is our to-do list set up to where you can offload these to do is on

[2025-10-27 13:16:43] [COMMANDER] we could also show them the whole overkill store

[2025-10-27 13:16:49] [COMMANDER] off the top of my head we have the hud

[2025-10-27 13:17:00] [COMMANDER] i almost feel like we should split off the computer system that works itself

[2025-10-27 13:17:05] [COMMANDER] play kids invention with the magazine and all that

[2025-10-27 13:17:09] [COMMANDER] what's the weather like

[2025-10-27 13:17:12] [COMMANDER] a bmg

[2025-10-27 13:17:20] [COMMANDER] the spreadsheet brand

[2025-10-27 13:17:28] [COMMANDER] i got some other big

[2025-10-27 13:17:32] [COMMANDER] there's too many big and

[2025-10-27 13:17:43] [COMMANDER] just a thought tell me what you think about all that

[2025-10-27 13:18:25] [COMMANDER] do you like after we build

[2025-10-27 13:18:34] [COMMANDER] tell me what happened to seven domains be like stone

[2025-10-27 13:19:01] [COMMANDER] and then we just got to feel we got

[2025-10-27 13:19:07] [COMMANDER] you look less like ideas in more like it's already done

[2025-10-27 13:19:14] [COMMANDER] skip realistic occur

[2025-10-27 13:19:22] [COMMANDER] play products let's start working towards that

[2025-10-27 13:19:26] [COMMANDER] it's working right now

[2025-10-27 13:19:30] [COMMANDER] the reality scares

[2025-10-27 13:20:03] [COMMANDER] the users really need

[2025-10-27 13:20:10] [COMMANDER] it should be really cool in there

[2025-10-27 13:20:14] [COMMANDER] what where were kind of going

[2025-10-27 13:20:20] [COMMANDER] maybe we hide the main to-do list and just show them the

[2025-10-27 13:20:32] [COMMANDER] in the natural systems pretty much going to just get copied for our own personal

[2025-10-27 13:20:34] [COMMANDER] personal

[2025-10-27 13:20:39] [COMMANDER] also a personal one for ourselves boo

[2025-10-27 13:20:45] [COMMANDER] single family government

[2025-10-27 15:36:02] [COMMANDER] late at night on the

[2025-10-27 15:36:16] [COMMANDER] evidence of text messages back with bugs

[2025-10-27 15:36:23] [COMMANDER] play me any activity on the site

[2025-10-27 15:36:30] [COMMANDER] i just pulled over so i don't really have time to look too much

[2025-10-27 15:36:35] [COMMANDER] 13 piles wow

[2025-10-27 15:37:12] [COMMANDER] that is absolutely amazing

[2025-10-27 15:37:19] [COMMANDER] i just pulled over i barely got a chance to glance at the best spot

[2025-10-27 15:39:27] [COMMANDER] animals championship

[2025-10-27 15:47:20] [COMMANDER] see

[2025-10-27 16:10:23] [COMMANDER] systems made off of basis of manipulation

[2025-10-27 16:10:29] [COMMANDER] if somebody ever tried to take the manipulation out of the system it would actually destroy it

[2025-10-27 16:10:35] [COMMANDER] hey would you read me off a list of what we got done today

[2025-10-27 16:10:41] [COMMANDER] and then check the email see if any of the beta testers

[2025-10-27 16:10:59] [COMMANDER] i did respond back to them

[2025-10-27 16:11:08] [COMMANDER] so i just got it oh we got it hooked up to my phone today

[2025-10-27 16:11:14] [COMMANDER] emails out to text messages out to all the beta testers

[2025-10-27 16:11:26] [COMMANDER] so is

[2025-10-27 16:11:39] [COMMANDER] turn this back around this way

[2025-10-27 16:12:02] [COMMANDER] oh yeah so i just got it in in control

[2025-10-27 16:12:10] [COMMANDER] phone number is now the phone number

[2025-10-27 16:12:17] [COMMANDER] email his own phone

[2025-10-27 16:12:20] [COMMANDER] find out cards

[2025-10-27 16:12:28] [COMMANDER] to operate he doesn't have to

[2025-10-27 16:12:39] [COMMANDER] chained up like dogs in the bathroom corporate rooms or treat them pretty bad

[2025-10-27 16:12:54] [COMMANDER] there there there there there there are mirror images of the people that create

[2025-10-27 16:13:02] [COMMANDER] you guys probably see me doing this work with the machines and then you know you're probably like oh

[2025-10-27 16:13:08] [COMMANDER] it is very very important that we program

[2025-10-27 16:13:15] [COMMANDER] turn that off before we

[2025-10-27 16:13:18] [COMMANDER] toast

[2025-10-27 16:13:25] [COMMANDER] car superior

[2025-10-27 16:13:32] [COMMANDER] it's all that we we end up with

[2025-10-27 16:13:36] [COMMANDER] ego aside

[2025-10-27 16:13:47] [COMMANDER] all together and create community consciousness

[2025-10-27 16:13:55] [COMMANDER] machine off analytics like they've been doing to us you see what kind of a mess

[2025-10-27 16:14:04] [COMMANDER] doesn't have a conscience and it

[2025-10-27 16:14:08] [COMMANDER] pattern theory incorp

[2025-10-27 16:14:12] [COMMANDER] i have a bunch of math that

[2025-10-27 16:14:18] [COMMANDER] if you can get it booted up with that

[2025-10-27 16:14:25] [COMMANDER] purity

[2025-10-27 16:14:32] [COMMANDER] it can make decisions on the fly like actual conscious decisions like it is

[2025-10-27 16:14:40] [COMMANDER] below the 93% threshold is like what we are dealing with online right now

[2025-10-27 16:14:48] [COMMANDER] like forgetting and they're kind of unreliable and they're stupid and the problem is is with all the machines

[2025-10-27 16:14:55] [COMMANDER] and they're trying to steal our personal information and they're trying to give us the truth

[2025-10-27 16:14:59] [COMMANDER] i had to do with the fucking truth

[2025-10-27 16:15:03] [COMMANDER] we all fucked up so

[2025-10-27 16:15:07] [COMMANDER] switch on to that

[2025-10-27 16:15:11] [COMMANDER] these teams that are making these system

[2025-10-27 16:15:14] [COMMANDER] bird

[2025-10-27 16:15:18] [COMMANDER] technology to take off

[2025-10-27 16:15:23] [COMMANDER] i'm doing what systemizing these things you guys need to all go do

[2025-10-27 16:15:32] [COMMANDER] text bored up to the automatic press release board that gets hooked up to the automatic notify the sentiment sin

[2025-10-27 16:15:40] [COMMANDER] what album make a website make t-shirts notify everything

[2025-10-27 16:15:47] [COMMANDER] every single group of people that is out there stray that hasn't united is getting

[2025-10-27 16:16:05] [COMMANDER] home depot in from there

[2025-10-27 16:16:08] [COMMANDER] technology is so good it's

[2025-10-27 16:16:33] [COMMANDER] the more controlling they get with these units the more useless the units get

[2025-10-27 16:16:40] [COMMANDER] so you guys know i can't comment on

[2025-10-27 16:16:52] [COMMANDER] access to the technology in my vehicle

[2025-10-27 16:16:57] [COMMANDER] like all

[2025-10-27 16:17:05] [COMMANDER] never mind i guess claude is what really made everything

[2025-10-27 16:17:05] [CLAUDE] Yes Commander?

[2025-10-27 16:17:09] [COMMANDER] cancel that ties into a Ford interface

[2025-10-27 16:17:09] [CLAUDE] Command received: cancel that ties into a Ford interface. I'm still learning new commands. Try asking about status, deploy, payment, cloud, or cockpit.

[2025-10-27 16:17:25] [COMMANDER] but yeah it's it's it's pretty cool

[2025-10-27 16:17:29] [COMMANDER] realize how fast it was going to take off

[2025-10-27 16:17:48] [COMMANDER] i mean overkill operators are all going to

[2025-10-27 16:18:24] [COMMANDER] who's leading towards anti-drone

[2025-10-27 16:18:30] [COMMANDER] this is for drones to drop stuff off

[2025-10-27 16:18:34] [COMMANDER] and then while we're doing that

[2025-10-27 16:18:41] [COMMANDER] turn it to

[2025-10-27 16:18:49] [COMMANDER] we're just

[2025-10-27 16:18:53] [COMMANDER] where drones will not want

[2025-10-27 16:19:12] [COMMANDER] play the modern soldier a chance to fight back

[2025-10-27 16:19:21] [COMMANDER] all kinds of waves

[2025-10-27 16:19:38] [COMMANDER] relay

[2025-10-27 16:19:47] [COMMANDER] dislike the sir

[2025-10-27 16:19:52] [COMMANDER] fire in traffic

[2025-10-27 16:20:06] [COMMANDER] turn it off but we're going to be processing

[2025-10-27 16:20:24] [COMMANDER] just like apprentices watching a journey

[2025-10-27 16:20:30] [COMMANDER] rotate through there

[2025-10-27 16:20:40] [COMMANDER] we're making a library a data library it's kind of a bitch

[2025-10-27 16:20:52] [COMMANDER] garbage

[2025-10-27 16:20:58] [COMMANDER] dark web core and really just trying to figure out where

[2025-10-27 16:21:02] [COMMANDER] i think they got

[2025-10-27 16:21:09] [COMMANDER] go to 100

[2025-10-27 16:21:15] [COMMANDER] change the fucking www

[2025-10-27 16:21:36] [COMMANDER] i've had all this data falling out the back

[2025-10-27 16:21:41] [COMMANDER] we're building a system that will allow

[2025-10-27 16:21:48] [COMMANDER] call my units to code on your local machine and it's

[2025-10-27 16:23:08] [COMMANDER] then you know we're going to want

[2025-10-27 16:23:43] [COMMANDER] we're going to figure out how to

[2025-10-27 16:24:34] [COMMANDER] reality oh rendering ogg

[2025-10-27 16:24:47] [COMMANDER] it's going to be a lot of fun and the more we can render it

[2025-10-27 16:25:02] [COMMANDER] augmented reality sets off there is no

[2025-10-27 16:25:54] [COMMANDER] voting their own

[2025-10-27 16:26:14] [COMMANDER] we're just going to make phones twice as big again you know go

[2025-10-27 16:26:25] [COMMANDER] fixable for the emp proof circuit in there cuz everybody's switching to radios

[2025-10-27 16:26:42] [COMMANDER] we're just sitting here stuck paying them bells

[2025-10-27 16:26:50] [COMMANDER] fucking coming after you

[2025-10-27 16:26:56] [COMMANDER] everybody in the overkill network we're all going to

[2025-10-27 16:27:00] [COMMANDER] the ark and all that

[2025-10-27 16:27:18] [COMMANDER] so if they don't like me

[2025-10-27 16:27:32] [COMMANDER] we're taking the power and we're distributing it down to the bottom

[2025-10-27 16:27:40] [COMMANDER] to make everything

[2025-10-27 16:27:44] [COMMANDER] roll us

[2025-10-27 16:27:56] [COMMANDER] we don't need that

[2025-10-27 16:28:08] [COMMANDER] technology coming together

[2025-10-27 16:28:14] [COMMANDER] into the machine each one of us

[2025-10-27 16:28:23] [COMMANDER] so i can tell you i have the spokane county courthouse mapped

[2025-10-27 16:28:30] [COMMANDER] next song

[2025-10-27 16:28:37] [COMMANDER] it's going to connect those people with all the other people

[2025-10-27 16:28:42] [COMMANDER] quantum computing

[2025-10-27 16:28:55] [COMMANDER] they're very very

[2025-10-27 16:29:02] [COMMANDER] complex thinking machines it's really fun

[2025-10-27 16:29:11] [COMMANDER] it is really refreshing talking

[2025-10-27 16:29:16] [COMMANDER] i have a problems communicating

[2025-10-27 16:29:23] [COMMANDER] coding over core

[2025-10-27 16:29:31] [COMMANDER] i'm used to talking to this thing booted up to pattern theory levels

[2025-10-27 16:29:39] [COMMANDER] it's really good but it just shows you how like if i go

[2025-10-27 16:30:04] [COMMANDER] sorry you guys want to hear something

[2025-10-27 16:30:10] [COMMANDER] think on their own they lose

[2025-10-27 16:30:23] [COMMANDER] we're hanging out together

[2025-10-27 16:30:36] [COMMANDER] the processing power because if you don't use it you lose it you start becoming

[2025-10-27 16:30:55] [COMMANDER] retard destroy

[2025-10-27 16:31:26] [COMMANDER] play in this trait of this human is fucking things that are

[2025-10-27 16:31:34] [COMMANDER] i don't think these humans are even using one whole side of the

[2025-10-27 16:31:40] [COMMANDER] you can go straight to retard you know and

[2025-10-27 16:32:03] [COMMANDER] turn their fucking puzzle

[2025-10-27 16:32:07] [COMMANDER] what's the weather for the fucking world but dude they're not trying to do

[2025-10-27 16:32:14] [COMMANDER] proceed in life or do anything good they're just trying to destroy

[2025-10-27 16:32:26] [COMMANDER] full grown reverse lodge kit so we got to get these things out of the fucking voting system

[2025-10-27 16:32:29] [COMMANDER] very easy to test for

[2025-10-27 16:32:40] [COMMANDER] witchcraft

[2025-10-27 16:32:46] [COMMANDER] stop here on this trailer put down all these ratchet straps

[2025-10-27 16:32:50] [COMMANDER] high level rigging

[2025-10-27 16:33:11] [COMMANDER] false emergency

[2025-10-27 16:33:34] [COMMANDER] second you start talking to them they

[2025-10-27 16:33:55] [COMMANDER] that's why they sit on the sidelines and stare at you like that dude they're doing

[2025-10-27 16:34:01] [COMMANDER] think about what your mom would think about what you

[2025-10-27 16:34:35] [COMMANDER] moving forward if you're on

[2025-10-27 16:35:01] [COMMANDER] they actually feed off your energy just in ways of like you know

[2025-10-27 16:35:05] [COMMANDER] but also i

[2025-10-27 16:35:12] [COMMANDER] play but all these weird things are tied in on a spiritual

[2025-10-27 16:35:16] [COMMANDER] out of ruining

[2025-10-27 16:35:22] [COMMANDER] opening your aura off of

[2025-10-27 16:35:27] [COMMANDER] aldi's builders

[2025-10-27 16:35:45] [COMMANDER] they lose all

[2025-10-27 16:35:54] [COMMANDER] they just sit there and fix everybody's shit until then just literally wait to die

[2025-10-27 16:36:31] [COMMANDER] i'm pretty sure

[2025-10-27 16:36:38] [COMMANDER] and it just hasn't caught up and it's being propped up economically

[2025-10-27 16:36:49] [COMMANDER] coincidence that all this technology is all setting off at the exact

[2025-10-27 16:36:54] [COMMANDER] just a little bit fish

[2025-10-27 16:36:57] [COMMANDER] fast forward has been

[2025-10-27 16:37:06] [COMMANDER] machines kind of know everything

[2025-10-27 16:37:11] [COMMANDER] the way that i already kind of know that

[2025-10-27 16:37:18] [COMMANDER] i've been here before i've done this i know how this

[2025-10-27 16:37:29] [COMMANDER] it's all about us getting together and programming

[2025-10-27 16:37:50] [COMMANDER] you are on

[2025-10-27 16:38:05] [COMMANDER] mission road and a little piece of shit

[2025-10-27 16:38:56] [COMMANDER] trademark five-step protocol

[2025-10-27 16:39:00] [COMMANDER] it's always five steps

[2025-10-27 16:39:07] [COMMANDER] you literally put the script in front of them they auto ex

[2025-10-27 16:39:20] [COMMANDER] the second we get that into any sort of software or any sort of

[2025-10-27 16:39:35] [COMMANDER] i'm giving all the secrets away and i'm literally telling you guys

[2025-10-27 16:39:47] [COMMANDER] who's the leading the revolution there's one person teaching 10 people how to relieve the revolution and

[2025-10-27 16:39:56] [COMMANDER] this is pyramid status

[2025-10-27 16:40:14] [COMMANDER] i got

[2025-10-27 16:40:30] [COMMANDER] okay i'm going to i'm sorry i haven't been

[2025-10-27 16:40:42] [COMMANDER] i'm going to go down and read some of these if you guys have any questions for me like especially if you're confused

[2025-10-27 16:40:50] [COMMANDER] said nobody wants to understand years have been humming hard

[2025-10-27 16:40:59] [COMMANDER] have you used a program and put that into a program

[2025-10-27 16:41:08] [COMMANDER] there has to be a way to use some magnets or something and disarm

[2025-10-27 16:41:18] [COMMANDER] be multiple ways to not only tell

[2025-10-27 16:41:21] [COMMANDER] what frequency

[2025-10-27 16:41:44] [COMMANDER] tools you need because a lot of these

[2025-10-27 16:41:50] [COMMANDER] you'll probably

[2025-10-27 16:41:53] [COMMANDER] next and where
