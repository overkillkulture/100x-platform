- Keep clothing and background consistent

- Use "professional lighting" in prompt
- Specify "clean background" to avoid clutter
- Add "high quality digital art" for better results

### **For Personality:**
- Emphasize "approachable" and "friendly" not "sexy" or "intimidating"
- "Intelligent but warm" is key
- "Tech-savvy but human" balance
- "Consciousness guide" energy not "generic AI assistant"

## 🎨 ALTERNATIVE: QUICK PLACEHOLDER

**If AI generation takes too long, use this temporary solution:**

Create SVG placeholder with initials:
```svg
<svg width="256" height="256" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <defs>
    <linearGradient id="bg" x1="0%" y1="0%" x2="100%" y2="100%">
      <stop offset="0%" style="stop-color:#001100" />
      <stop offset="100%" style="stop-color:#003300" />
    </linearGradient>
  </defs>
  <circle cx="128" cy="128" r="120" fill="url(#bg)" stroke="#0f0" stroke-width="4"/>
  <text x="128" y="148" font-size="80" fill="#0f0" text-anchor="middle" font-family="Courier New" font-weight="bold">ARIA</text>
  <circle cx="128" cy="128" r="124" fill="none" stroke="#0f0" stroke-width="2" opacity="0.3"/>
</svg>
```

This gives us something better than egg icon while we wait for full avatar.
