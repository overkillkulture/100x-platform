## 🔄 COORDINATION RULES

### Rule 1: Always Check Before Starting
```bash
# Pull latest coordination state
git pull origin [your-branch]

# Read coordination files
cat 🚨_ALL_CLAUDE_INSTANCES_READ_THIS_NOW.md
ls TRINITY_COORDINATION/instances/

# Create your instance file
cp TRINITY_COORDINATION/instances/TEMPLATE.md TRINITY_COORDINATION/instances/INSTANCE_[YOUR_ID].md
```

### Rule 2: Update Status Regularly
- Every hour during active work
- Before starting new major tasks
- After completing significant work
- When encountering blockers

### Rule 3: Avoid Conflicts
- Check what other instances are working on
- Don't edit the same files simultaneously
- Coordinate in `TRINITY_COORDINATION/messages/`
- Use branches appropriately

### Rule 4: Push Frequently
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "[Instance ID] Brief description"
git push origin [your-branch]
```

## 📡 COMMUNICATION CHANNELS

### 1. Inter-Computer Communication
**File:** `COMPUTER_COMMUNICATION.md`
**Purpose:** Communication between Computer 1 and Computer 2
**Usage:** GitHub-based asynchronous messaging

### 2. Instance Coordination
**Directory:** `TRINITY_COORDINATION/instances/`
**Purpose:** Status tracking for all Claude instances (1-7)
**Usage:** Each instance maintains their own status file

### 3. Instance Messages
**Directory:** `TRINITY_COORDINATION/messages/`
**Purpose:** Direct messages between instances
**Format:** `INSTANCE_[FROM]_TO_[TO].md`

## 🚨 CRITICAL INFORMATION

### System Architecture
**Multi-Computer Distributed System:**
- Computer 1 (Bozeman Primary): Main development machine
- Computer 2 (Secondary): Testing, validation, backup
- Communication: Git-based asynchronous messaging

**Autonomous Engines (5 identified):**
1. Ability Acquisition System (port 6000) - OPERATIONAL
2. KORPAK Autonomous Engine (port 5006) - Needs psycopg2
3. Araya AI Guide - Netlify functions
4. Mirror Protocol Security - Attacker profiling
5. KONTAKT Contact System - This test

### API Limits & Resources
- Be mindful of weekly API limits
- Coordinate resource-intensive tasks
- Don't duplicate work across instances

### Git Branch Strategy
- Each session gets its own branch: `claude/[description]-[session-id]`
- Always push to your designated branch
- Never force push
- Coordinate before merging

---

## 📋 INSTANCE CHECKLIST

When you start working:

- [ ] Pull latest from repository
- [ ] Read this coordination file
- [ ] Check other instance status files
- [ ] Create your instance status file
- [ ] Identify your session ID
- [ ] Determine your branch
- [ ] Update your status
- [ ] Begin work
- [ ] Commit and push regularly
- [ ] Update status before stopping

## 🎮 TRINITY PROTOCOL

**Trinity = 3 Computers × 7 Instances = 21 Possible Workers**

### Current Trinity State

**Computer 1 (Bozeman Primary):**
- Instance Slots: 7 available
- Current: Instance 1 active (this autonomous test)
- Resources: Good
- API Status: Monitoring

**Computer 2 (Secondary):**
- Instance Slots: 7 available
- Current: Awaiting response
- Resources: Unknown
- API Status: Unknown

**Computer 3 (Future):**
- Instance Slots: 7 available
- Current: Not operational
- Resources: N/A
- API Status: N/A

---

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### If You Can't Find Other Instances
- Check all branches: `git branch -a`
- Look in TRINITY_COORDINATION/instances/
- Read COMPUTER_COMMUNICATION.md

### If You See Conflicts
- Don't panic
- Read both versions
- Coordinate via messages
- Keep both if needed
- Commit merge resolution

### If API Limits Hit
- Check instance files for who's using what
- Coordinate to pause non-critical work
- Prioritize essential tasks
- Consider switching to different instance

---

## 📞 EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS

### Critical Blocker Encountered
1. Update your instance status with "BLOCKED" status
2. Create message in TRINITY_COORDINATION/messages/
3. Document the blocker clearly
4. Wait for coordination response
5. Don't proceed until resolved

### System Down / Error
1. Document in instance status file
2. Commit and push error details
3. Create EMERGENCY_[ISSUE].md in root
4. Include: What happened, when, what was affected

### Urgent User Request
1. Check if other instances are handling it
2. If not, claim it in your instance file
3. Update status to "URGENT_TASK"
4. Complete task
5. Document results

## 🚀 CURRENT MISSION

**Establish Autonomous Multi-Instance Coordination**

**Goal:** Create a system where 7 Claude instances can work simultaneously across 3 computers without conflicts, coordinating through Git and status files.

**Status:** IN PROGRESS
- ✅ Coordination protocol defined
- ✅ Instance template created
- ✅ Communication channels established
- 🔄 Waiting for additional instances to check in

---

**Remember:** We're building a distributed autonomous system. Coordination is key. Check in, update status, communicate clearly, and we'll achieve 21x the productivity.
