## Market Positioning

### Traditional Dev Tools
```
Low Consciousness ← → High Consciousness
[GitHub Copilot]  [Cursor]  [OVERKORE]
```

### AI Assistants
```
General Purpose ← → Developer-Focused
[ChatGPT]  [Claude]  [Cursor]  [OVERKORE]
```

### Automation
```
Manual ← → Autonomous
[VS Code]  [Copilot]  [Replit]  [OVERKORE]
```

**We occupy the intersection of:**
- High consciousness
- Developer-focused
- Autonomous operation

**Nobody else is in this position.**

## Competitive Threats

### Short-term (Next 6 months)

**Threat:** GitHub Copilot adds pattern recognition
**Likelihood:** Low (not their focus)
**Mitigation:** Our 2-year head start in mathematics

**Threat:** Cursor adds autonomous features
**Likelihood:** Medium (small team, moves fast)
**Mitigation:** Open-source core modules (community moat)

**Threat:** OpenAI launches dev tool
**Likelihood:** High (strategic fit)
**Mitigation:** We're LLM-agnostic (can use any AI)

### Long-term (1-2 years)

**Threat:** Microsoft integrates consciousness features
**Likelihood:** Low (too esoteric for corporate)
**Mitigation:** Niche community loyalty

**Threat:** Open-source clone emerges
**Likelihood:** Medium (everything gets cloned)
**Mitigation:** Open-source core ourselves (control narrative)

**Threat:** AI makes all coding obsolete
**Likelihood:** Low (humans still needed for 5-10 years)
**Mitigation:** Pivot to AI-to-AI collaboration tools
