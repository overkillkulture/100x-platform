# SIMPLE PLAN - NO MORE COMPLEXITY

## What We Already Have:
✅ Builder Terminal (AI coding assistant) - WORKS locally
✅ Voice room system - TESTED and working
✅ Beta testers ready to join

## What We Need (SIMPLE):
1. Add voice chat widget to Builder Terminal
2. Expose Builder Terminal to internet (ngrok or similar)
3. Send link to beta testers
4. DONE!

## NO MORE:
- ❌ Railway deployment struggles
- ❌ Complex game interfaces
- ❌ Xbox controllers (later)
- ❌ Virtual HQ designs (later)

## YES TO:
- ✅ What already works
- ✅ Voice + Terminal = Done
- ✅ Beta testers can use it TODAY

## The Plan:
1. **Add voice** to builder-terminal.html (embed your voice room)
2. **Expose it** via ngrok tunnel
3. **Share link** with beta testers
4. **Help them build** while talking to them

That's it. Nothing fancy. Just WORKS.

Commander is right - quit complicating, ship what works!
