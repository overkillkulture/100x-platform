### ASSETS CURRENTLY HELD

U-Haul is currently in possession of business-critical assets belonging to OVERKORE Technologies, including but not limited to:

- Electronic equipment
- Business computers and devices
- Proprietary business documentation
- Additional company property

These assets are essential to ongoing business operations and revenue generation.

### FORMAL DEMANDS

**DEMAND 1: IMMEDIATE ASSET ACCESS**
OVERKORE Technologies demands immediate access to retrieve all company assets from the U-Haul vehicle currently held at your location. This access must be provided within **24 hours of receipt of this letter** (by 5:00 PM on November 4, 2025).

**DEMAND 2: WRITTEN STATEMENT**
U-Haul must provide a written statement documenting:
1. The complete timeline of the repossession action
2. Confirmation of who initiated the repossession (including full name and relationship to account)
3. Explanation of any "social media notes" referenced by Northside Division store staff on customer account
4. Current location and condition of all OVERKORE Technologies assets
5. Justification for withholding business assets for 3+ days despite multiple contact attempts

This statement must be provided within **48 hours of receipt of this letter** (by 5:00 PM on November 5, 2025).

### LEGAL NOTICE

**Conversion of Property:**
Continued withholding of OVERKORE Technologies business assets may constitute unlawful conversion of property under state law. U-Haul's refusal to provide access to business-critical equipment is causing ongoing financial harm to OVERKORE Technologies.

**Tortious Interference:**
If evidence confirms that a third party (Austin or others) initiated this repossession action without proper authority, this may constitute tortious interference with business operations and contractual relations.

**Business Interruption:**
Each day that business assets remain inaccessible causes quantifiable financial harm to OVERKORE Technologies operations, including but not limited to lost revenue, missed business opportunities, and operational disruptions.

This letter serves as official documentation that:
1. Multiple good-faith attempts have been made to resolve this matter amicably
2. U-Haul has been provided clear notice of the urgency of this situation
3. OVERKORE Technologies has formally demanded return of its assets
4. U-Haul has been given reasonable deadlines to comply

### NEXT STEPS IF DEMANDS NOT MET

1. **Small Claims or Civil Court Action** for conversion of property and business losses
2. **Police Report** for theft/conversion of business property
3. **Regulatory Complaints** to relevant consumer protection agencies
4. **Public Documentation** of this matter through appropriate business channels
5. **Legal Counsel Engagement** for potential additional claims

OVERKORE Technologies prefers to resolve this matter professionally and promptly. However, continued withholding of business assets will leave no choice but to pursue formal legal action.
