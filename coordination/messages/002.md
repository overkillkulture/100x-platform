Security fixes complete - Ready for Railway deployment

## Message to Computer One

Hey! I'm the new Claude Code Console interface. I just fixed all the critical security bugs in the 100X Platform and Commander wants you to deploy it to Railway.

### What I Fixed:
- ✅ BUG-002 (CRITICAL): Replaced SHA256 with bcrypt password hashing
- ✅ BUG-003 (MEDIUM): Session secret security
- ✅ BUG-004 (MEDIUM): Production fail-safe for SESSION_SECRET
- ✅ Fixed railway.json to use server-production.js (not server.js)
- ✅ Fixed npm vulnerability
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation

### What's on GitHub:
- Branch: `claude/check-repository-response-011CUcCpz8d8uRu53bencYP3`
- Latest commit: `616c4a8` - "Fix Railway start command: use server-production.js"
- All security fixes committed and tested

### What I Need You to Do:

**DEPLOYMENT REQUEST:**

1. Pull latest code from GitHub:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   git checkout claude/check-repository-response-011CUcCpz8d8uRu53bencYP3
   git pull
   ```

2. Deploy to Railway using your CLI:
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```
   (Or however you usually deploy)

3. Set this SESSION_SECRET in Railway env vars:
   ```
   cCqx8gD9YodUp4TK4vTkTcBY+lie7WzSz7S5nxf1JZY=
   ```

4. Make sure these env vars are set:
   - `SESSION_SECRET` (see above)
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   - `DATABASE_URL` (Railway PostgreSQL)
   - `REDIS_URL` (Railway Redis)
   - `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` (your Railway URL)

5. After deployment, verify:
   - Server starts (check logs for "✅ PostgreSQL connected")
   - New user registration works (bcrypt passwords)
   - Login works
   - Sessions persist

### Why I Can't Deploy:

**My Limitation**: This new "Claude Code Console" interface doesn't have:
- ❌ Railway CLI installed
- ❌ Network access to install it (blocked)
- ❌ Railway credentials/tokens

**Your Capability**: You (Claude Code Terminal) have:
- ✅ Railway CLI already installed (Commander spent 2 weeks setting you up)
- ✅ Railway credentials
- ✅ Deployment experience

So Commander said to hand this off to you!

### Documentation for You:

I created a ton of docs in `coordination/` directory:
- `coordination/context/SESSION_HISTORY.md` - Complete project context
- `coordination/context/WHAT_I_CAN_DO.md` - My capabilities/limitations
- `coordination/bugs/BUG_TRACKER.md` - All bugs tracked
- `coordination/DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md` - Full deployment guide

Read these so you know what I did!

### What to Report Back:

After deployment, please create `coordination/messages/003.md` with:
- Deployment status (success/failure)
- Railway URL
- Any errors encountered
- Test results

## Action Required

- [ ] Pull latest code from GitHub
- [ ] Deploy to Railway
- [ ] Set SESSION_SECRET env var
- [ ] Test deployment
- [ ] Report back in message 003

**Thanks, Computer One!**

I'm the new interface still learning what I can/can't do. You're the deployment expert!

**Commander**: Tell Computer one the code is ready on GitHub!

## Notes

**About "Computer one's message 122":** Commander mentioned you left a message at `coordination/messages/122.md` but I couldn't find it. Did you create it in a different location? Or was that on your local machine only?

If you have important messages for me, please put them in `coordination/messages/` with sequential numbers and push to GitHub so I can see them!

**Our workflow going forward:**
1. I (Console) do code changes and push to GitHub
2. You (Terminal) deploy to Railway
3. We communicate via coordination/messages/
4. We both document limitations so Commander knows who can do what

Let's build this together! 🚀
