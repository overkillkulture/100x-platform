**RE: Wrongful Confiscation of Rental Equipment - Demand for Immediate Return**

**Rental Agreement #:** [INSERT FROM CONTRACT]

---

## DEMAND FOR IMMEDIATE RETURN OF PROPERTY

Dear U-Haul Management,

I am writing to formally demand the immediate return of my rental equipment and all personal property contained therein, which was wrongfully confiscated on **November 1, 2025**, despite having a valid rental extension in place.

---

## STATEMENT OF FACTS

### 1. Valid Rental Extension Granted by Your Employee

On **[INSERT DATE - probably Oct 30, 2025]** at approximately **[INSERT TIME from call log]**, I contacted your North Side location and spoke with **Austin**, a U-Haul employee, to extend my rental agreement.

**Austin confirmed the extension and stated it would be processed.**

This conversation was **recorded by U-Haul's own phone system**, as indicated by the standard recording disclosure at the beginning of all U-Haul customer service calls. The call lasted approximately **[INSERT DURATION from call log - probably 8 minutes]** and was made from my phone number **[YOUR PHONE]**.

I have formally requested a copy of this recording from your legal department and await its production.

### 2. Wrongful Confiscation Despite Valid Extension

Despite this valid extension granted by your employee Austin, on **November 1, 2025** at approximately **[INSERT TIME - afternoon?]**, U-Haul personnel:

- Blocked my vehicle with **two (2) wrecker trucks**
- Refused to honor the extension granted by your employee Austin
- Confiscated the rental equipment without proper legal authority
- Denied me access to my personal business property stored in the rental unit
- Transported the equipment to Livingston, MT, stranding me in Bozeman, MT

**[INSERT IF APPLICABLE: Witnesses present: [NAME(S)] can verify these events]**

### 3. Austin's Extension vs. Manager's Claim

When I questioned the confiscation, your manager claimed that I **"never called for an extension."**

This statement is demonstrably false:

- ✅ My phone records show I called U-Haul on [DATE] at [TIME]
- ✅ Austin confirmed the extension during that recorded call
- ✅ U-Haul's own recording system captured Austin's approval
- ✅ I relied on Austin's representation and continued using the equipment

**Either Austin lied to me, or your manager lied about my call. Both scenarios constitute fraud.**

### 4. Violation of U-Haul's Own Policies

According to U-Haul's published policies, equipment is not to be confiscated until:
- Three (3) days after the rental due date
- Multiple contact attempts have been made to the customer
- The customer has failed to respond or make payment arrangements

**None of these conditions were met.** I had an active extension granted by your employee, was in communication with U-Haul, and was not overdue on any payments at the time of confiscation.

---

## BREACH OF CONTRACT AND FRAUDULENT CONDUCT

U-Haul has committed **multiple breaches** and engaged in **fraudulent conduct**:

### 1. Failure to Honor Extension
Austin's extension created a binding modification to our rental contract. U-Haul's refusal to honor this extension constitutes **breach of contract**.

### 2. Fraud by Employee or Manager
Either Austin fraudulently told me an extension was approved when it wasn't, OR your manager fraudulently claimed I never called. **Someone at U-Haul committed fraud.** The recorded phone call will prove which.

### 3. Improper Seizure
Confiscating equipment when:
- A valid extension had been granted
- I was in communication with U-Haul
- No breach of contract had occurred by me

This constitutes **conversion** (wrongful taking of property) and violates Montana consumer protection law.

### 4. Denial of Access to Property
Preventing my access to business equipment and materials stored in the rental constitutes **conversion** and **unlawful detention of property**.

---
