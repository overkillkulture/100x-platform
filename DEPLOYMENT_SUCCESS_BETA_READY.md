## 📋 WHAT WORKS RIGHT NOW

✅ **Homepage redirect** - No more "Coming Soon" blocker

✅ **Visual design** - Professional cyberpunk aesthetic
✅ **Navigation flow** - Smooth progression through all pages

## ⚠️ KNOWN LIMITATIONS (Non-Critical)

**Backend APIs Not Connected:**
- The workspace tries to connect to localhost:7779 and localhost:6666
- These won't work on live site (expected behavior)
- Features still display, just with "Loading..." placeholders
- Users can still access all pages and see the interface

**Impact:** Minimal - users can explore workspace, just without live data

**Solution (Optional):** Deploy LOCAL_NERVE_COLLECTOR.py to Railway for live tracking
