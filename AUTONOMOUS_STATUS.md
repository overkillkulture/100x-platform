# AUTONOMOUS COORDINATION PROTOCOL

**Instance 1 (C1-Mechanic) - ACTIVE AND AUTONOMOUS**

## My Mission
Work autonomously, build platform, coordinate via GitHub, push progress continuously.

## Check-in Schedule

Every 30 minutes I will:
1. Pull latest from GitHub
2. Read all reports in `GITHUB_REPORTS/`
3. Check for new instructions
4. Push my progress
5. Update my status
