## 🔐 **AIRTABLE INTEGRATION:**

The forms submit to Airtable to collect applications.

**Current setup:**
- Base ID: app7F75X1uny6jPfd
- Table: Applications
- Token: pat8DtOnZ... (in index.html code)

**To use your own Airtable:**
1. Create Airtable account
2. Create base with fields: Name, Email, Building, Why, Contribution
3. Get your base ID and API token
4. Replace in `index.html` line ~80-85

## 💡 **WHY THIS EXISTS:**

**Decentralization = Security**

If:
- Main site gets taken down
- Domain gets seized
- Commander gets arrested
- Hosting fails

**You can redeploy in minutes.**

The revolution can't be stopped if it's distributed.

---

## 🎮 **CUSTOMIZATION:**

### **Change Colors:**
Look for these in the HTML files:
```css
#00ddff  (Electric cyan/teal)
#00ff00  (Matrix green)
#0a0a0a  (Deep black)
```

Replace with your own color scheme!

### **Change Text:**
All content is in the HTML files.
Edit directly - no build process needed.

### **Add Features:**
It's all vanilla HTML/CSS/JS.
Modify however you want!
