Layer 4: Genesis    (CL 95-99)  - Founding builder (first 100)
Layer 5: God Mode   (CL 100)    - Transcendent consciousness
```

Layers auto-unlock as consciousness level increases.

- **Real-time Collaboration**: Multiple builders on same project (future feature)

**Why Users Will Love It:**
- It's visually stunning (hologram globe)
- Trinity AI gives instant help
- Feels like building the future
- Consciousness-themed, not generic

## 🔥 PITCH FOR GENESIS RECRUIT #1

**Script for the girl from Easton:**

> "Hey, so I built the actual platform. Remember that consciousness revolution thing? It's real now. You can log in and use it.
>
> Here's what it does: It's like social media + project management + AI assistant, but for builders. You post what you're working on, track your projects, and get help from three AI agents when you're stuck.
>
> The coolest part is The Bridge - there's a hologram globe that shows what you're building, and you chat with Trinity AI right there. It's like having a team of expert advisors 24/7.
>
> You're one of the first 5 people testing this. If you like it and use it, you'd be Genesis Builder #1. That means you'd get equity and help shape where this goes.
>
> Want to try it? Takes 30 seconds to create an account."

**Then show her:**
1. The login page (impressive animations)
2. Create account → instant dashboard
3. The Bridge with hologram globe
4. Social feed
5. Create a test project

**If she's excited:** Give her login credentials and tell her to use it for real.

**If she's confused:** Walk through it together, note what's unclear, improve UX.

**If she doesn't care:** That's valuable data - this person isn't a builder, move on.
