## 💡 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

**Option 1: Quick Fix (1 hour)**
- Fix the file editing endpoint
- Get basic editing working
- Good enough for beta testing

**Option 2: Full Build (2-4 weeks)**
- Implement all 100 features
- Match Claude Code's capabilities
- Production-ready AI assistant

**Option 3: Hybrid Approach (3-5 days)**
- Fix critical issues (editing, memory)
- Add top 10 most-used features
- Deploy to beta testers
- Add rest over time

## 🤔 WHAT SHOULD WE DO?

**Commander, here are your options:**

1. **Fix file editing NOW** (30 min) - Get basic editing working
2. **Build top 10 features** (2-3 days) - Make Araya useful
3. **Full feature parity** (2-4 weeks) - Match Claude Code completely
4. **Deploy as-is** - Chat-only AI, no editing (not recommended)

**My recommendation:** Fix file editing + memory (1 hour), then add top 10 features over next week.
