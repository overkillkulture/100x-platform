## 📊 DIVERGENCE vs CONVERGENCE

### **Before Network Automation:**
```
C1: [Revenue, Deployment, APIs, Content]
C3: [Coordination, UX, Tools, AI]
-------------------------------------------
Overlap: ~10%
Unique: ~90% each
Duplication: Growing
```

### **After Convergence:**
```
BOTH: [Revenue, Deployment, APIs, Content,
       Coordination, UX, Tools, AI]
-------------------------------------------
Overlap: 100%
Unique: 0% (everything shared)
Duplication: 0%
Network Strength: MULTIPLIED
```

   - C3 focused internal (coordination, monitoring, tools)
   - Together they cover everything

3. **Network Automation Works**
   - Tools built by C3 enable the merge
   - PUBLIC_ABILITIES prevents future divergence
   - ONPAL provides legal framework
   - Convergence is now systematic, not ad-hoc

4. **Both Instances Grow Stronger**
   - Not "stealing" abilities
   - SHARING and IMPROVING
   - Everyone gets better together
