# 📚 Trinity Book Outline (DEMO)

**What Happened:**
Trinity correctly analyzed this as a HIGH-COMPLEXITY task (writing a book outline) and attempted to route it to the online API (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) for best quality.

However, the `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is not set, so the system couldn't complete the request.

**What Trinity Would Produce:**
Below is what C2 Architect would generate when properly configured:
