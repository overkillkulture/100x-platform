## 💪 YOU DON'T NEED AN ATTORNEY

### For Demand Letter: NO ATTORNEY NEEDED ✅
- You're just stating facts
- Demanding return of property
- Explaining legal basis
- Setting deadline

**This is basic communication - you can do this**

### For Lawsuit: MAYBE ATTORNEY NEEDED
- If they ignore demand letter
- You can still file pro se (self-represented)
- Montana small claims: up to $10,000 (no attorney allowed)
- Montana district court: $10,000+ (attorney optional but recommended)

**BUT**: Since your damages are $100K+, you'd file in district court where attorney helps but isn't required

### Alternative: Contingency Attorney
- They take 30-40% of settlement
- No upfront costs
- Only get paid if you win
- **But only if you can't/won't do it yourself**

**Your approach (no attorney for demand letter) = SMART**:
1. Send demand letter yourself (free)
2. If they settle: ✅ You keep 100% of money
3. If they don't: Then consider attorney for lawsuit
