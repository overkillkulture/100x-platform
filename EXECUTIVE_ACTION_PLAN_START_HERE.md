## ✅ DECISION CHECKLIST (5 MINUTES)

### **DECISION 1: Launch JARVIS This Week?**
- [ ] **YES** - Package ZIP, deploy landing page (1 day work)
- [ ] **NO** - Wait for _____ (specify reason)

**If YES, you need:**
- [ ] 4 hours to package files + test
- [ ] Domain/subdomain for landing page
- [ ] Email list to announce to (or start fresh)

---

### **DECISION 2: Start Podcast MVP Monday Nov 11?**
- [ ] **YES** - 2-week sprint, launch Nov 25

- [ ] $200 budget (Stripe, AWS, APIs setup)
- [ ] PostgreSQL + Redis setup (can use free tiers)

---

### **DECISION 3: Development Approach?**
- [ ] **SELF-CODE** - You build everything
- [ ] **HIRE 1 CONTRACTOR** - $5-10K/month, parallel work possible
- [ ] **HIRE TEAM** - $15-30K/month, very fast execution
- [ ] **HYBRID** - You + 1 contractor

**Budget Impact:**
- Self-code: $0 labor, slower timeline
- 1 contractor: $30-40K for 3 months (all 3 MVPs)
- Team: $60-90K for 2 months (all 3 MVPs + Music)

---

### **DECISION 4: External Services Budget?**
- [ ] Stripe account (free to set up, 2.9% + 30¢ per transaction)
- [ ] AWS S3 (~$50-200/mo for file storage)
- [ ] DigitalOcean (~$50-150/mo for hosting)
- [ ] Domain names (~$50/year total)
- [ ] **TOTAL MONTHLY:** ~$150-400/mo infrastructure

**Can you commit to this?**
- [ ] YES - Start immediately
- [ ] NO - Need funding first

---

### **DECISION 5: Priorities Confirmed?**
**Recommended order:**
1. JARVIS free (Week 1) - Brand building
2. Podcast MVP (Weeks 2-3) - Fastest to $50K MRR
3. Social Media MVP (Weeks 4-7) - Highest revenue potential

**Do you agree?**
- [ ] YES - Execute as planned
- [ ] NO - I prefer: _____ (specify different order)

## ⚠️ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Build everything at once (launch incrementally)
- ❌ Spend months perfecting (ship MVP, iterate)
- ❌ Try to compete with everyone (pick your battles)
- ❌ Ignore metrics (track everything from day 1)
- ❌ Work alone if stuck (hire help when needed)

**DO:**
- ✅ Launch JARVIS free first (brand building)
- ✅ Get first paying customer ASAP (validates model)
- ✅ Ship Podcast before it's "perfect" (iterate)
- ✅ Talk to users constantly (feedback drives product)
- ✅ Hire when revenue justifies it ($10K MRR = can afford developer)

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

### **Week 1 (JARVIS Launch):**
- ✅ 100+ downloads

## 📞 WHEN YOU NEED HELP

### **Stuck on technical implementation?**
- All specs have code samples
- Join developer communities (Stack Overflow, Discord)
- Hire contractor on Upwork ($50-150/hr)

### **Need validation before building?**
- Launch landing page FIRST
- Collect emails before writing code
- 100+ emails = validated demand

### **Running out of time?**
- Hire contractor immediately
- Or: Launch JARVIS only, wait on others
- Or: Focus on 1 module (Podcast), skip rest

### **Running out of money?**
- JARVIS is free to launch (no hosting needed)
- Bootstrap with Podcast revenue
- Or: Raise friends & family round ($50-100K)
