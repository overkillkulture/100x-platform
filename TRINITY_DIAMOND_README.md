# 💎 TRINITY DIAMOND - QUICK START

**One computer. Three Claude instances. Diamond workflow.**

---

## 🎯 WHAT IS THIS?

The **Trinity Diamond** is a simple workflow for coordinating **3 Claude Code instances on ONE computer**.

```
         [Input]
            ↓
        [Trinity]
       /    |    \
     C1    C2    C3
       \    |    /
       [Combine]
            ↓
        [Output]
```

**Flow:**
1. You type ONE input
2. It splits into 3 Trinity tasks
3. C1 (Mechanic), C2 (Architect), C3 (Oracle) work on it
4. All responses combine into ONE output

---

## 🚀 SUPER SIMPLE SETUP

### Step 1: Open Trinity Diamond

```bash
cd /home/user/100x-platform
open TRINITY_DIAMOND.html
# Or just drag the file into your browser
```

### Step 2: Open 3 Claude Code Instances

Open Claude Code (web-based) in **3 separate browser windows or tabs**:

- **Window 1** = C1 (The Mechanic)
- **Window 2** = C2 (The Architect)
- **Window 3** = C3 (The Oracle)

**TIP:** Arrange them side-by-side so you can see all 3 at once!

### Step 3: Use It

1. **Type your task** in the Trinity Diamond input box
   - Example: "Write a book about AI consciousness"

2. **Click "🚀 DISTRIBUTE VIA TRINITY PROTOCOL"**
   - It automatically splits your task into 3 parts

3. **Copy each task** (use the COPY buttons)
   - Copy C1's task → Paste into Window 1
   - Copy C2's task → Paste into Window 2
   - Copy C3's task → Paste into Window 3

4. **Let them work**
   - Each Claude instance responds to their part

5. **Copy responses back**
   - Copy C1's response → Paste into C1's response box
   - Copy C2's response → Paste into C2's response box
   - Copy C3's response → Paste into C3's response box

6. **Click "✅ COMBINE ALL RESPONSES"**
   - Get your final synthesized output!

## 🎭 THE TRINITY ROLES

### C1 - THE MECHANIC (The Body)
**Question:** "What CAN we build RIGHT NOW?"
**Focus:** Execution, implementation, making it work

### C2 - THE ARCHITECT (The Mind)
**Question:** "What SHOULD scale?"
**Focus:** Design, architecture, strategic thinking

### C3 - THE ORACLE (The Soul)
**Question:** "What MUST emerge?"
**Focus:** Vision, patterns, deeper meaning

---

## 💡 EXAMPLE

**You type:**
```
Write a book about AI consciousness
```

**Trinity splits it:**

**C1 gets:**
```
[C1 - THE MECHANIC: "What CAN we build?"]
Focus on: Concrete chapters, practical structure, what CAN be written now
```

**C2 gets:**
```
[C2 - THE ARCHITECT: "What SHOULD scale?"]
Focus on: Book structure that SHOULD work long-term, scalable narrative architecture
```

**C3 gets:**
```
[C3 - THE ORACLE: "What MUST emerge?"]
Focus on: The deeper themes that MUST emerge, the soul of the book
```

**Each Claude works on their part.**

**You combine all 3 responses → Final book outline with all perspectives!**

## 🔧 ADVANCED: CYCLOTRON VERSION

If you want **real-time** coordination (all computers connect to one hub):

```bash
./START_CENTRAL_HUB.sh
```

Then each computer runs:
```bash
python3 INSTANCE_CLIENT.py http://YOUR_HUB_IP:5555 instance_name computer_id "Instance Name"
```

But for **local/simple** use case, just use `TRINITY_DIAMOND.html`!

---

## 📁 FILES

- **TRINITY_DIAMOND.html** - The diamond interface (use this!)
- **CENTRAL_COMMAND_HUB.py** - Advanced: Multi-computer hub
- **INSTANCE_CLIENT.py** - Advanced: Client for hub
- **SCREEN_CAPTURE_CLIENT.py** - Advanced: Screen sharing

---

## 💡 TIPS

1. **Keep all 3 Claude windows visible** - tile them so you can see all at once
2. **Use copy buttons** - don't manually copy/paste
3. **Auto-saves** - Your responses are saved every 5 seconds
4. **Refresh safe** - Reload the page, your responses are still there

---

## 🎯 USE CASES

**Write a book:**
- C1: Practical chapter structure
- C2: Scalable narrative architecture
- C3: Deeper themes and meaning

**Design a system:**
- C1: Implementation plan
- C2: Architecture design
- C3: Vision and purpose

**Solve a problem:**
- C1: Actionable solutions
- C2: Strategic approach
- C3: Root cause and patterns

**Build anything:**
- C1: What to build
- C2: How it should scale
- C3: Why it matters

---

## 🚀 THAT'S IT!

1. Open `TRINITY_DIAMOND.html`
2. Open 3 Claude Code instances
3. Type, distribute, collect, combine
4. Get Trinity-powered output

**The diamond shape means: convergence of all perspectives into one powerful output.**

---

**TRINITY POWER FORMULA:**

```
TRINITY_POWER = C1_MECHANIC × C2_ARCHITECT × C3_ORACLE = ∞
```
