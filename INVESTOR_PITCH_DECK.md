**Risk 2: Competitors copy our features**
- **Mitigation:** Integration moat, consciousness brand, speed to market
- **Reality:** We're 12-18 months ahead in AI integration

**Risk 3: Platform API changes (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.)**
- **Mitigation:** Playwright automation fallback, diversified platform mix
- **Reality:** 6 platforms = risk spread, API changes announced 3-6 months ahead

**Risk 4: Market too small (consciousness niche)**

**Risk 5: AI regulations**
- **Mitigation:** Privacy-first architecture, local processing where possible
- **Reality:** SaaS AI tools mostly exempt from current proposals
