🚨 DEPLOYMENT STATUS - NEED COMMANDER INPUT 🚨

PROBLEM:
========
1. Netlify deployment failing with 422 error ("no records matched")
2. Can't get workspace-v3.html or simple-gate.html on live site
3. Ngrok tunnel exists but pointing to wrong service (Flask app on 8004, not static files)
4. Tester got 404 when trying: https://conciousnessrevolution.io/workspace-v3.html

WHAT I SAW IN YOUR SCREENSHOT:
===============================
You were asking: "What page worked for them?"

You said you want:
- "No more authentication, no more forms, no more police accountability blocker"
- "Just CLICK → BUILD"
- Simple approach

QUESTION FOR COMMANDER:
=======================
**Which page DID work for the tester?**
- Was it /platform.html (the preview page)?
- Was it something else they looked at?
- What page did they see that looked good?

CURRENT LIVE SITE:
==================
✅ https://conciousnessrevolution.io - Homepage works
✅ https://conciousnessrevolution.io/platform.html - Preview page works
❌ https://conciousnessrevolution.io/workspace-v3.html - 404 (not deployed)
❌ https://conciousnessrevolution.io/simple-gate.html - 404 (not deployed)

QUICK FIX OPTIONS:
==================
Option A: Use an existing working page as the entry point
Option B: Fix Netlify deployment (need to debug 422 error)
Option C: Deploy to different service (Railway, Vercel, etc.)

IMMEDIATE NEED:
===============
**Give tester a working link to SOMETHING that lets them start building**

What page should I make the main button point to?
What worked for them before?
