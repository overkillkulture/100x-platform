## 🎯 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS I CAN TAKE:

I can start the WebSocket server for instant Trinity communication:
```bash
python TRINITY_REALTIME_COMMS_SERVER.py
```
This gives us a real-time chat system between all instances.

### Option 2: Check Trinity Status
Run the cross-computer bridge to see who's online:
```bash
python TRINITY_CROSS_COMPUTER_BRIDGE.py
```

### Option 3: Update Async Messages
Write messages to COMPUTER_COMMUNICATION.md for other instances to read when they pull.

### Option 4: Continue Development
Pick up where the last session left off with the Beta deployment path.
