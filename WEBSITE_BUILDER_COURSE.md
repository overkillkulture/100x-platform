In Week 4, you'll build a complete e-commerce system:

```javascript
// Week 4 Project: Accept payments like consciousness kits
const stripe = require('stripe')('your_key_here');

app.post('/checkout', async (req, res) => {
  const session = await stripe.checkout.Session.create({
    line_items: [{
      price: 'price_id_for_joy_kit',
      quantity: 1,
    }],
    mode: 'payment',
    success_url: 'https://yoursite.com/success',
    metadata: {
      college_fund_percentage: '40',
