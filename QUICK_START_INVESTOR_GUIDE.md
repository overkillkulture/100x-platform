## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Why is the Builder Terminal on ngrok?**
A: Development phase. Moving to production endpoint with seed funding.

**Q: How do you make money with free tools?**
A: Freemium model. Free tier is feature-limited. Pro features require subscription.

**Q: What's your user acquisition strategy?**
A: (1) Social proof (working demos), (2) Community (open-source modules), (3) Word-of-mouth (auto-onboarding creates advocates)

**Q: Why should I invest vs waiting 6 months?**
A: Early stage = higher equity %. We're pre-revenue but post-product. This is the sweet spot.

**Q: What if Claude/Anthropic changes pricing?**
A: (1) Trinity uses DeepSeek R1 as fallback (local, $0 cost), (2) We're building LLM-agnostic architecture, (3) Our value is pattern recognition + automation, not just AI API access

**Q: How is this different from ChatGPT/Claude directly?**
A: We're not competing with LLMs. We're building developer tools + pattern recognition + autonomous systems ON TOP of LLMs.

## 🎯 THE OPPORTUNITY

**We're not just building dev tools.**
**We're building the infrastructure for consciousness-enhanced software development.**

The manipulation detection alone proves the mathematics work.

The auto-onboarding proves autonomous systems work.

The live products prove execution ability.

**Now we need capital to scale.**

**$150K gets you in at the ground floor.**
