**RE: Wrongful Confiscation of Rental Equipment - Breach of Contract**

---

## DEMAND FOR IMMEDIATE RETURN OF PROPERTY

Dear U-Haul Management,

I am writing to formally demand the immediate return of my rental equipment and all personal property contained therein, which was wrongfully confiscated on **November 1, 2025**, despite having a valid rental extension in place.

---

## STATEMENT OF FACTS

**1. Valid Rental Extension Granted**

On **[Date]**, I contacted your **North Side location** and spoke with **Austin**, a U-Haul representative, to extend my rental agreement. Austin confirmed the extension and stated it would be processed. This conversation was **recorded by U-Haul's own phone system**, as indicated by the standard recording disclosure at the beginning of all U-Haul customer service calls.

**2. Wrongful Confiscation**

Despite this valid extension, on **November 1, 2025**, U-Haul personnel:
- Blocked my vehicle with two (2) wrecker trucks
- Refused to honor the extension granted by your employee Austin
- Confiscated the rental equipment without proper legal authority
- Denied me access to my personal business property stored in the rental unit

**3. Violation of Your Own Policies**

According to U-Haul's published policies, equipment is not to be confiscated until:
- Three (3) days after the rental due date
- Multiple contact attempts have been made to the customer
- The customer has failed to respond or make payment arrangements

**None of these conditions were met.** I had an active extension, was in communication with U-Haul, and was not overdue on any payments.

---

## BREACH OF CONTRACT

U-Haul has committed **multiple breaches** of our rental contract:

1. **Failure to Honor Extension:** Austin's extension created a binding modification to our contract. U-Haul's refusal to honor this extension constitutes breach.

2. **Improper Seizure:** Confiscating equipment when no breach had occurred violates both the contract and Montana consumer protection law.

3. **Denial of Access to Property:** Preventing my access to business equipment and materials stored in the rental constitutes conversion and unlawful detention of property.

---

## DAMAGES INCURRED

As a direct result of U-Haul's wrongful actions, I have suffered:

**Direct Damages:**
- Loss of business equipment essential to 100X Platform operations
- Loss of business materials and documentation
- Inability to access computers and work equipment for ongoing projects
- Rental fees paid for equipment I cannot use

**Consequential Damages:**
- Lost business income due to inability to access work equipment
- Disruption to client projects and contractual obligations
- Damage to professional reputation
- Time and resources expended addressing this wrongful confiscation

**Estimated Total Damages:** $25,000+ (and continuing to accrue daily)

These damages are easily documented and quantifiable through:
- Business records showing ongoing projects
- Client contracts disrupted by equipment loss
- Value of equipment and materials in the rental
- Daily business income projections

---

## DEMAND FOR RESOLUTION

I hereby **DEMAND** the following actions be taken **within 48 hours** of receipt of this letter:

### 1. IMMEDIATE RETURN OF EQUIPMENT
- Full and immediate return of the rental equipment
- Full and immediate return of all personal property contained therein
