## WHY THIS WORKS

**Legal Right**: You're a party to the call = you have right to the recording

**U-Haul Disclosed**: They announce "calls are recorded" = they admit recording exists

**Discovery Alternative**: If they refuse, you can subpoena it in court (but this gives them chance to provide voluntarily)

**Creates Paper Trail**:
- If they provide it = you have evidence
- If they refuse = you document they're hiding evidence
- If they "lost it" = you document suspicious deletion

## EXPECTED RESPONSES

### Response 1: "We'll provide the recording"
**Result**: ✅ You get Austin on tape saying extension approved
**Next Step**: Use in demand letter as evidence

### Response 2: "We need you to fill out form XYZ"
**Result**: They're stalling but will provide
**Next Step**: Fill out their form, resend request

### Response 3: "We can't locate that recording"
**Result**: Suspicious - all calls are recorded
**Next Step**: Note in demand letter "U-Haul suspiciously unable to locate recording"

### Response 4: "We don't provide recordings to customers"
**Result**: Violation of your rights as party to conversation
**Next Step**: Note in demand letter "U-Haul refused to provide recording despite legal obligation"

### Response 5: No response
**Result**: They're ignoring you
**Next Step**: Send demand letter anyway, note "U-Haul failed to respond to recording request"

**ALL RESPONSES HELP YOUR CASE** - Either you get evidence OR you document they're hiding evidence.
