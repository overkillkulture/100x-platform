## 🔄 HOW THIS WORKS IN PRACTICE

### Example: Book about "Araya"

**In Domain TOC (Mind Matrix book):**
- Chapter 7: "Araya - Your AI Companion"
- Brief overview, points to full Araya book

**In Feature TOC (Araya book):**
- Complete deep dive on Araya
- How it integrates with Mind Matrix
- How it integrates with Soul Sanctuary
- Cross-domain implementation

**Reader can find it either way:**
- "I'm interested in Mind Matrix domain" → finds Araya
- "I heard about Araya" → finds it directly in feature TOC

```markdown

## 🔍 SURFACING BURIED IDEAS

**System prompt for Trinity C3:**

"Read all 468 markdown files and extract:
1. Any feature/product idea with revenue potential
2. Current status (built, in-progress, concept)
3. Which domain it belongs to
4. Add to MASTER_FEATURE_DOMAIN_MAP.md"

**This will surface the 5+ multi-billion dollar ideas currently buried.**

---

## ✅ ACTION ITEMS

1. **Create MASTER_FEATURE_DOMAIN_MAP.md**
   - Map all features to domains
   - Map all domains to features
   - Two-way index

2. **Define Domains 8-10**
   - You said ~10 domains total
   - Currently have 7 defined
   - What are the other 3?

3. **Extract buried ideas**
   - Trinity C3 task: Read 468 docs
   - Find multi-billion dollar concepts
   - Add to master map

4. **Dual TOC for every book**
   - "Find this by Feature" section
   - "Find this by Domain" section
   - Cross-references throughout

5. **Update book roadmap**
   - Series 1: Features (15 books)
   - Series 2: Domains (10 books)
   - Series 3: Modules (20 books)
   - Series 4: Foundations (7 books)
   - Total: 52 weeks

## 💡 WHY THIS MATTERS

**Problem:** "Araya is buried in Mind Matrix docs"
**Solution:** Araya gets its own book (Week 4) AND appears in Mind Matrix book (Week 17)

**Problem:** "ARK spans multiple domains, hard to understand"
**Solution:** ARK book (Week 1) explains the whole thing, domain books reference it

**Problem:** "5+ billion-dollar ideas are lost in 468 files"
**Solution:** Trinity C3 extracts them, adds to master map, each gets a book

**Result:** Nothing gets buried. Two ways to find everything.

---

**STATUS: Dual organization system designed. Ready to implement when Trinity boots up.** 📊

Features don't get buried anymore. Domains stay organized. Best of both worlds.
