**Questions to ask:**

2. "Did Austin have authority to make decisions about Contract #92559832?"
3. "Why wasn't I notified before repossession action?"
4. "What is the official policy for returning customer property from repossessed vehicles?"

- Allow you to complete the rental period OR return your property
- Handle customer property with reasonable care
- Not arbitrarily interfere with legitimate rentals

**Their breaches:**
- Withholding your property without justification
- Failing to respond to reasonable retrieval requests
- Acting on unauthorized third-party interference (Austin)

## AUSTIN'S INTERFERENCE - CONTRACT ANGLE

**Critical question:** What did Austin tell U-Haul when he called about Contract #92559832?

**Possibilities:**
1. He claimed to be an authorized party on the contract (FALSE REPRESENTATION)
2. He made false claims about the rental (DEFAMATION/FRAUD)
3. He claimed the vehicle was stolen or misused (FALSE REPORT)
4. He claimed you violated contract terms (FALSE ACCUSATION)

**Why this matters:**
Any false statements Austin made to trigger repossession of Contract #92559832 could be:
- Fraud (if he misrepresented his authority)
- Defamation (if he made false claims about you)
- Tortious interference (if he deliberately disrupted your contract)
- Conspiracy (if he coordinated with others)

**What to demand:**
Complete transcript or detailed notes of Austin's call regarding Contract #92559832, including:
- What he claimed his relationship to the contract was
- What specific statements he made
- Whether U-Haul verified any of his claims
- What authorization he provided

## THE SMOKING GUN

1. Austin had NO legitimate authority over Contract #92559832, AND
2. Austin made false statements to U-Haul about the contract, AND

4. This caused harm to your business...
