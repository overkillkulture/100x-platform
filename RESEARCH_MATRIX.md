# 🔬 DIMENSIONAL CASCADE - RESEARCH MATRIX

**Phase 1: Bootstrap - Know What We Don't Know**
**Generated:** October 9, 2025
**Purpose:** Research industry standards BEFORE building anything

---

## 🎯 THE RESEARCH APPROACH

### **What Commander Said:**
> "You don't know what you don't know so it should start with building up a bootstrap of all the different areas first... research software designing, research the team members, figure out all the different things that they do... filling up whole spreadsheet full of things to search... start with data collection, then blueprinting. Don't reinvent the wheel."

### **The Process:**
```
1. BOOTSTRAP: Identify all areas to research
2. DATA COLLECTION: Gather information from each area
3. ANALYSIS: Find patterns and best practices
4. BLUEPRINT: Create master plan based on research
5. BUILD: Execute according to blueprint
```

## 💡 WHY THIS MATTERS

### **Without Research:**
```
Guess → Build → Wrong → Rebuild → Guess again → Repeat
```

### **With Research:**
```
Research → Learn patterns → Blueprint → Build once → Success
```

**Commander's insight: Don't reinvent the wheel. Learn from those who already built it, then build better.** 🔬⚡🎯
