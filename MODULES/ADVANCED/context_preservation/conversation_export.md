Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It involves algorithms that can identify patterns, make predictions, and improve performance over time.

Sure! Email spam filters use machine learning. They learn to identify spam by analyzing thousands of emails labeled as spam or not spam, then automatically classify new emails based on those patterns.
