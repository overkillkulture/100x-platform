🤖 Announcing JARVIS Assistant - Your Personal AI Voice Assistant

After weeks of development, I'm excited to launch JARVIS Assistant - a
voice-controlled AI assistant powered by Anthropic's Claude AI.

💡 WHY I BUILT THIS:

Voice assistants like Alexa and Siri are great for simple tasks, but they
fall short on complex requests. I wanted an assistant that could:

• Understand nuanced questions
• Write code and debug errors
• Help with research and writing
• Respect privacy (no cloud storage)
• Be customizable and open source

So I built JARVIS.

🎤 WHAT IT DOES:

"JARVIS, explain quantum entanglement in simple terms."
"JARVIS, write a Python script to analyze CSV data."
"JARVIS, help me draft an email to my team."

It responds in 1-2 seconds with intelligent, contextual answers.

🔒 PRIVACY FIRST:

JARVIS runs on your computer. Your data never leaves your machine (except
API calls to Anthropic). No tracking, no analytics.

💰 PRICING:

100% free. You bring your own Anthropic API key (costs ~$3-10/month for
heavy users). Open source (MIT license).

🚀 GET STARTED:

assistants? What would you use JARVIS for?

• Open-source (MIT license)
• Free forever (users pay only for API usage)

AVAILABILITY:

JARVIS Assistant is available for immediate download at
conciousnessrevolution.io/jarvis. The software is free and open source under
the MIT license. Users need an Anthropic API key, which costs approximately
$3-10 per month depending on usage.

tools. The platform includes voice assistants, content automation, and
workflow optimization tools designed to amplify human capabilities.
