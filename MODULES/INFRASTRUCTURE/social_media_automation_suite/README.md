### 3. Smart Scheduling & Optimal Timing

**AI determines best times to post:**

**Data analyzed:**

- Time zones (if international audience)

**Auto-scheduling modes:**
- Optimal (AI picks best times)
- Consistent (same time daily, e.g., 9am)
- Evergreen (space out over time)
- Burst (multiple posts rapid-fire for launches)

**Queue system:**
- Add 100 posts to queue
- AI publishes 3 per day at optimal times
- Never runs out (queue auto-refills with AI content)

**Time zone management:**
- Audience in multiple time zones?
- AI posts for each time zone's peak hours
- Example: 9am ET, 9am PT (two posts same content, different times)
