## 🚀 GETTING STARTED

### Step 1: Create Your First Case (5 minutes)

```python
# Using the API
from pi_mapping import PIMapper

mapper = PIMapper(api_key="your_key")

# Create case
case = mapper.create_case(
    title="Washington Family Court - Manipulation Case",
    case_type="family_law",
    jurisdiction="Washington State"
)

print(f"Case created: {case.case_id}")
```

Or use the web interface:
1. Go to: conciousnessrevolution.io/pi-mapping
2. Click "New Case"
3. Enter case details
4. Upload first piece of evidence

---

### Step 2: Upload Evidence (10 minutes)

```python
# Upload document
evidence = case.add_evidence(
    file_path="court_documents.pdf",
    evidence_type="court_filing",
    date="2025-10-15",
    description="Opposing counsel's motion"
)

# AI automatically extracts entities
print(f"Entities found: {len(evidence.entities)}")
for entity in evidence.entities:
    print(f"  - {entity.name} ({entity.type})")
```

---

### Step 3: Generate Map (Automatic)

```python
# Map is generated automatically as evidence is added
case_map = case.get_relationship_map()

print(f"Entities mapped: {len(case_map.entities)}")
print(f"Relationships found: {len(case_map.relationships)}")

# View in browser
case_map.visualize(output="map.html")
```

---

### Step 4: Run Pattern Theory Analysis (30 seconds)

```python
# Analyze entire case for manipulation
analysis = case.analyze_manipulation()

print(f"Overall manipulation score: {analysis.score}/100")
print(f"Status: {analysis.status}")
print(f"\nTop manipulators:")
for entity in analysis.top_manipulators:
    print(f"  - {entity.name}: {entity.manipulation_score}/100")
    print(f"    Tactics: {', '.join(entity.tactics)}")
```

---

### Step 5: Export Court-Ready Report (1 minute)

```python
# Generate comprehensive report
report = case.export_report(
    format="pdf",
    include_timeline=True,
    include_map=True,
    include_pattern_analysis=True
)

print(f"Report generated: {report.filename}")
# Output: washington_family_case_report_2025-11-04.pdf
```
