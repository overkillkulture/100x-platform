# 🌐 3D CORRUPTION MAPPING SYSTEM

**Revolutionary Transparency Tool - Visualize Corruption Networks in 3D Space**

---

## 🎯 WHAT IS 3D CORRUPTION MAPPING?

**The Problem:**
- Corruption is invisible - hidden in complex networks
- Money trails span multiple entities, accounts, countries
- Connections between people, companies, politicians are obscure
- Traditional 2D org charts miss the full picture
- Investigators spend months manually tracking connections
- Dark money flows undetected
- No visual way to see the full corruption network

**The Solution:**
- Interactive 3D visualization of corruption networks
- Automatic money trail tracking (bank accounts, crypto, shell companies)
- Entity relationship mapping (people, companies, politicians, donors)
- Pattern Theory detection of manipulation patterns
- Blockchain transparency (track dark money on-chain)
- Time-based visualization (watch corruption evolve over time)
- Public transparency + premium investigator tools

**Result:**
- See the full corruption network in 3D space
- Track money from source to destination
- Identify key players and connections
- Detect manipulation patterns automatically
- Export evidence for legal cases
- Public accountability through transparency

## 💡 HOW IT WORKS

### Corruption Mapping Flow:

```
1. Data Input
   ↓
   Upload documents, financial records, public data
   Blockchain addresses, company registrations, court filings

2. Entity Extraction (AI)
   ↓
   Claude AI extracts: people, companies, transactions, relationships

3. Relationship Mapping
   ↓
   Build network graph: who paid whom, who owns what, who controls who

4. Pattern Detection
   ↓
   Pattern Theory identifies: shell company networks, circular payments,
   suspicious timing, hidden connections

5. 3D Visualization
   ↓
   Render corruption network in 3D:
   - People = Blue spheres
   - Companies = Green cubes
   - Money flows = Red lines (thickness = amount)
   - Crypto = Yellow nodes
   - Time axis = Z-depth

6. Analysis & Export
   ↓
   Interactive exploration, evidence export, legal reports
```

- **Companies:** Green cubes (size = revenue)
- **Money flows:** Red lines (thickness = amount)
- **Cryptocurrency:** Yellow nodes

### 3. Money Trail Tracking
**Follow the money:**
- Start from any entity (person, company, wallet)
- Trace all incoming and outgoing payments
- Multi-hop tracking (A → B → C → D)
- Circular payment detection

### 4. Pattern Theory Corruption Detection
**AI-powered corruption patterns:**

**Shell Company Networks:**
- Multiple companies, same address
- Circular ownership structures
- Nominee directors
- Zero employee companies with large revenues

**Suspicious Timing:**
- Payment right before contract awarded
- Money movement right before election
- Transfers after scandal breaks

**Hidden Connections:**
- Family members on boards
- Shared addresses/phones/emails
- Interlocking directorates
- Nominee shareholders

**Corruption Confidence Score:**
```
C = (SE × ST × HC × MF × PP) × TD

SE = Shell Entity factor (0-1)
ST = Suspicious Timing (0-1)
HC = Hidden Connections (0-1)
MF = Money Flow anomalies (0-1)
PP = Pattern Presence (0-1)
TD = Transaction Density multiplier

C > 0.8 = HIGHLY SUSPICIOUS (red)
C > 0.6 = SUSPICIOUS (orange)
C > 0.4 = QUESTIONABLE (yellow)
C < 0.4 = NORMAL (green)
```

## 📊 CORRUPTION DETECTION ALGORITHMS

### Shell Company Detection:
```python
def detect_shell_companies(network):
    """Identify likely shell companies"""

    shell_indicators = []

    for company in network.companies:
        score = 0

        # No employees
        if company.employees == 0:
            score += 0.3

        # Same address as other companies
        same_address_count = count_companies_at_address(company.address)
        if same_address_count > 5:
            score += 0.2

        # Nominee director (serves on many boards)
        if company.director_board_count > 10:
            score += 0.2

        # Large revenue, no operations
        if company.revenue > 1000000 and company.employees == 0:
            score += 0.3

        if score > 0.6:
            shell_indicators.append({
                'company': company,
                'confidence': score,
                'reason': 'Multiple shell company indicators'
            })

    return shell_indicators
```

### Suspicious Timing Detection:
```python
def detect_suspicious_timing(network):
    """Find payments with suspicious timing"""

    suspicious = []

    for payment in network.payments:
        # Payment right before contract award
        for contract in network.contracts:
            days_before = (contract.date - payment.date).days

            if 0 < days_before < 30:
                if payment.from_entity in contract.related_entities:
                    suspicious.append({
                        'payment': payment,
                        'contract': contract,
                        'days_before': days_before,
                        'suspicion_level': 'HIGH',
                        'reason': f'Payment {days_before} days before contract'
                    })

    return suspicious
```

## ⚡ WHY THIS MATTERS

**Corruption is invisible until it's visualized.**

Traditional corruption investigations:
- 6-12 months manually tracking connections
- Miss hidden relationships
- Can't see the full network
- Evidence scattered across documents

**With 3D Corruption Mapping:**
- 2-7 days to map complete network
- AI finds connections humans miss
- Full network visible in 3D space
- Evidence automatically compiled

**Social Impact:**
- Journalists expose corruption faster
- Citizens hold officials accountable
- Investigators build stronger cases
- Whistleblowers have safe platform
- Transparency becomes default

**This is how corruption dies - by being seen.**
