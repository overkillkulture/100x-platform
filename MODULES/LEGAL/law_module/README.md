## 💡 THE PATTERN (Why This Works)

**Traditional Legal System:**
```
Problem → Attorney ($5K-50K) → Attorney solves it → You stay dependent
```

**Pro Se with Law Module:**
```
Problem → Law Module (free) → YOU solve it → Pattern learned → Help others
```

**Network Effect:**
- 1st user: Documents their case, we learn what works
- 10th user: Gets templates from 9 successful cases
- 100th user: Gets battle-tested strategies from 99 wins
- 1000th user: Corporation sees pattern, changes behavior
- Result: Justice becomes accessible, corruption becomes unprofitable
