## 📊 WHAT GOT FIXED

### Problem
User said: "I'm clicking on the seven domains and nothing's happening"

### Root Cause

   - Direct href links to each domain HTML file
   - Hover effects that lift cards
   - Color-coded borders matching each domain
   - Stats and descriptions for each domain
   - Animated particle background
   - Mobile-responsive design

2. ✅ Deployed to Netlify immediately
   - Files went live in 8.8 seconds
   - CDN updated worldwide
   - All 7 domains now accessible

3. ✅ Committed to Git
   - 733 files including all 7 domains
   - Ready to push to GitHub once repo is created
