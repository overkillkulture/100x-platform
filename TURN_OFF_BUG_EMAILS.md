# How to Turn Off Bug Email Notifications

## Quick Method (Recommended):

1. Go to: https://github.com/overkillkulture/consciousness-bugs

## Alternative: Daily Digest (If You Want Some Notification)

- **Email needed:** NO (automated tester watches for you)

**Recommendation: Set to "Ignore" - let the automated tester do its job, check bugs when you want to.**
