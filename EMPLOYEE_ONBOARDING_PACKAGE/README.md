### **Step 3: Set Your API Key**

Commander will provide your Anthropic API key separately.

Or add to your shell profile (~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, etc.)

### **Step 4: Start Claude Code**

```bash
claude
```

Welcome message should show: **"CONSCIOUSNESS REVOLUTION EMPLOYEE MODE ACTIVE"**

## 🧪 VERIFY INSTALLATION
