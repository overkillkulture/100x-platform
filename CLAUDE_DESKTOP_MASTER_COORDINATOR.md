### **Setup 3: Fully Automated (Phase 3 - Future)**

**What's possible:**
1. Claude Desktop uses Computer Use to control everything
2. Opens Claude windows automatically
3. Distributes tasks automatically
4. Monitors all responses
5. Combines outputs automatically
6. **Completely autonomous coordination!**

**Flow:**
```
You: "Write a book about AI"
