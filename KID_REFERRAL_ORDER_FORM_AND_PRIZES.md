# 🏆 CONSCIOUSNESS KITS - KID REFERRAL ORDER FORM & PRIZE PROGRAM

## THE GIRL SCOUT COOKIE MODEL (But Better)

**What Girl Scouts do:**
- Give kids order forms
- Kids go door-to-door
- Track sales on paper
- Earn prizes for hitting milestones
- Top sellers get big rewards

**What we're doing BETTER:**
- Give kids order forms + stickers + cards
- Kids share at school/sports/activities (safer than door-to-door)
- Track sales digitally (QR codes, unique links)
- Earn prizes + CASH commission (Girl Scouts don't pay cash!)
- Top sellers get REAL business training + summit trip
