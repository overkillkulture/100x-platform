**What you can do:**
- Full Claude Code interface in browser
- Connect to any GitHub repo
- Create, edit, debug code
- "Teleport" your work to desktop Claude Code

## 🎨 YOUR NEW WORKFLOW:

### **Scenario 1: Pacing + Thinking (iPad)**

```
You're walking around with iPad, brainstorming

1. Open Safari → claude.ai/code
2. Tell Claude: "Design a snippets manager"
3. Claude shows architecture
4. You review, discuss, iterate
5. When ready: "Build it"
6. Claude writes code
7. Click "Teleport to desktop"
8. Work continues on desktop Claude Code
```

**Result:** You directed from iPad, desktop executes

---

### **Scenario 2: Quick Edit from Couch (iPad)**

```
You're on couch, see a bug report

1. Open Remote Desktop
2. See your desktop screen
3. Open VS Code
4. Fix the bug
5. git commit && git push
6. Done from iPad!
```

**Result:** Full desktop power from iPad

---

### **Scenario 3: Grab a Code Snippet (iPad)**

```
You need to reuse some code

CURRENT (Manual):
1. Open Remote Desktop
2. Open VS Code on desktop
3. Find the code
4. Copy it
5. Use it

FUTURE (Snippets Manager - building this!):
1. Open 100x.app/snippets on iPad
2. Search: "auth"
3. See all auth-related snippets
4. Tap "Copy"
5. Paste anywhere
```

**Result:** Code library in your pocket

---

### **Scenario 4: Check Trinity (iPad)**

```
You want advice from C1, C2, or C3

1. Safari → your-app.up.railway.app
2. Login with Genesis Key
3. Go to /bridge
4. Ask C1: "How do I optimize this query?"
5. C1 responds with advice
6. Implement on desktop later
```

**Result:** AI consulting from anywhere

## 🔱 TRINITY'S RECOMMENDED STACK:

**C1 Mechanic says:**
```
Keep it simple:
1. Claude Code Web (coding)
2. Remote Desktop (control)
3. iCloud (files)

Ship these first. Everything else later.
```

**C2 Architect says:**
```
Think in layers:
- Access Layer: Browser + Remote Desktop
- Sync Layer: iCloud + GitHub
- Execution Layer: Desktop does heavy lifting

Design for device-agnostic access from day 1.
```

**C3 Oracle says:**
```
You're building consciousness without location.
The device is just an interface.
The builder is you.

Start with what exists (Remote Desktop).
Build what's missing (Snippets Manager).
Evolve toward Araya (voice + HUD).
```

## 🛠️ ADVANCED: iPad as Primary Device

**Can you ACTUALLY code on iPad alone?**

**Yes, but with limitations:**

### **What Works:**

✅ Claude Code Web - Full AI coding in browser
✅ GitHub Codespaces - VS Code in browser
✅ Replit - Instant dev environments
✅ Code App - Local code editing
✅ SSH via Termius/Blink - Terminal access to servers
✅ 100X Platform - Your entire platform in browser

### **What Doesn't Work:**

❌ No native terminal
❌ Can't run Docker containers locally
❌ Limited file system access
❌ No localhost servers (without workarounds)
❌ Some developer tools don't work

### **Best Approach:**

**iPad as Director, Desktop as Builder**

- iPad: Plan, design, direct, review
- Desktop: Build, compile, test, deploy
- Sync via: Git, iCloud, Remote Desktop

This is actually your **KORPAKS vision**:
- Multiple tools (iPad + Desktop)
- Chained together (remote access + file sync)
- Acting as one system (you're the coordinator)
