## Philosophy

Every release of this platform embodies Pattern Theory™:

> **Builders share. Destroyers hoard.**
> **Open source = Destroyer repellent by design.**
> **The code isn't the moat. The community is the moat.**

By open-sourcing everything, we create software that:
- Attracts the right people (builders)
- Repels the wrong people (destroyers)
- Protects communities automatically
- Can't be shut down (distributed across 1000 builders)

---

## Version Numbering

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):

- **MAJOR** (X.0.0): Breaking changes to Baby Gate API or Pattern Filter scoring
- **MINOR** (0.X.0): New modules, features, or significant enhancements (backwards compatible)
- **PATCH** (0.0.X): Bug fixes, documentation updates, minor tweaks
