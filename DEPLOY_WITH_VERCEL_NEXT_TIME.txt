NETLIFY IS BROKEN - USE VERCEL INSTEAD

Current Status:
✅ https://conciousnessrevolution.io - WORKS
✅ Homepage and workflow.html - LIVE
❌ workspace-v3.html - NOT DEPLOYED (Netlify CLI broken)

Next Time:
1. Install Vercel CLI: npm i -g vercel
2. Run: vercel --prod
3. Done

OR use Vercel dashboard (drag and drop like Netlify was supposed to work)

Netlify Error: 422 "no records matched" - don't waste time on it anymore
