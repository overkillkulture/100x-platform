## 🌐 NETWORK GROWTH

**As the network grows:**
- More abilities get shared
- Best implementations become canonical
- Duplicate work decreases
- Network gets stronger

**The goal:** Abilities MULTIPLY (everyone gets better), not FRAGMENT (everyone diverges)

---

## 📊 SHARING STATISTICS

**Current Status:**
- Public Abilities: Growing
- Active Contributors: All network computers
- License: ONPAL
- Coordination: Perfect (0 conflicts)

## 💡 PHILOSOPHY

**Traditional Open Source:**
- Everyone builds independently
- Code fragments across repos
- Duplicate work
- No coordination

**Overkore Network:**
- Shared ability inventory
- Public/private controls
- Automated discovery
- Guided merging
- Convergence over fragmentation

**Result:** Network that grows STRONGER as it grows LARGER
