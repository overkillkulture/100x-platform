## 🎯 DOMINO PRIORITY FORMULA

```
DOMINO SCORE = (Impact × Urgency × Unlocks) / Time

Where:
- Impact: How much this matters (1-10)
- Urgency: How soon it's needed (1-10)
- Unlocks: Number of dependent systems (1-10)
- Time: Hours to complete (lower = better)
```

### **SCORES:**

**#1 - Airtable Setup:**
```
Score = (10 × 10 × 10) / 0.25 hours = 4,000
```
**CLEAR WINNER** 🏆

**#2 - Production URL:**
```
Score = (8 × 8 × 8) / 0.17 hours = 3,012
```
**Strong Second**

**#3 - Stripe Complete:**
```
Score = (7 × 9 × 7) / 0.5 hours = 882
```

**#4 - API Batch:**
```
Score = (6 × 6 × 8) / 2 hours = 144
```

**#5 - Backend/Auth:**
```
Score = (5 × 4 × 6) / 4 hours = 30
```

## 🚫 ANTI-PATTERNS (Don't Do These)

**❌ Building backend first**
- 4 hours of work
- Blocks nothing critical
- Premature optimization

**❌ Perfect DNS setup**
- Can use netlify URL temporarily
- Not blocking submissions
- Can fix later

**❌ Complete API integrations**
- 2 hours of work
- Not needed for basic gate
- Nice-to-have, not must-have

**❌ Full authentication system**
- Complex, time-consuming
- Not needed for screening
- Can add after validation

**Start with the DOMINO, not the decoration.**
