  "reason": "Cannot fix without knowing which page has the layout distortion. Bug was submitted before page tracking was added to bug reporter (Bug #24/73 fixed this). User described CSS issue with 'nested over to the side all distorted' but didn't specify page URL or page name.",
  "note": "If reporter can provide the page where they saw this issue, we can investigate and fix the CSS problem."
