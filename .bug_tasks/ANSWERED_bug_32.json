I noticed that you're doing a lot of stuff here and you're doing a great job but I just want to check if you're running that automatic bugger check that the commander told you about the commander and stored some installed some protocols so that you would automatically check for bugs and then create the fixes. Additionally, you should be sending emails to users back so that they know what you've worked on what you did to fix it and they know where to go check you know for that for the items.\r\n\n**Message ID:** SMd35d3e593e8a9d986d321d9e73292e19\n**Received:** 2025-10-28T19:28:05.418Z",
