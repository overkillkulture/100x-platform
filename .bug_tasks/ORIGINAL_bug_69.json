  "description": "**Bug reported via web form**\n\n**Reporter:** Christopher Michael Dobbins\n\n**Description:**\nwhen you get bugs you need to send a user a response in github or email documenting what you did and explain it to the user in a small detailed summary we need to know how you view the web pages and how you see the changes because you think in code and we see with human eyes to describe things. We need a way to communicate so we know exactly what eachother is talking/thinking about.\n\n**Submitted:** 2025-10-29T17:10:35.075Z",
