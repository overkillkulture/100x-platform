  "reason": "Cannot fix without knowing which page or feature is experiencing the infinite loop. Bug was submitted before page tracking was added to bug reporter (Bug #24/73 fixed this). Need to know: Which page? What action triggered it? What behavior indicates a loop (page refresh, loading spinner, redirect loop, etc.)?",
  "note": "If reporter can provide specific page and steps to reproduce, we can investigate and fix the loop."
