## 💎 KEY METRICS TO TRACK

### **Customer Acquisition:**
- **CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost):** Target <$50
- **LTV (Lifetime Value):** Target >$500 (10mo avg retention × $50 avg price)
- **LTV:CAC Ratio:** Target >10:1

### **Growth:**
- **MoM Growth Rate:** Target 20-30% (doubling every 3-4 months)
- **Churn Rate:** Target <5% monthly (95% retention)
- **Conversion Rate (Free → Paid):** Target 5-10%

### **Unit Economics:**
| Metric | Target | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| ARPU (Avg Revenue Per User) | $60/mo | Mix of $19-199 tiers |
| Gross Margin | >85% | Software margins |
| Payback Period | <2 months | Fast cash flow positive |

---

## 🎯 BREAKEVEN ANALYSIS

### **Monthly Fixed Costs:**
```
Infrastructure:                $535
APIs (minimum):                $800
Team (1 contractor):           $8,000
Marketing:                     $1,000
───────────────────────
TOTAL:                         $10,335/mo
```

### **Breakeven at different price points:**

**If ARPU = $60/mo:**
- Need: 172 paying customers
- At 40% conversion: Need 430 total users
- **Timeline: Month 2-3** (very fast breakeven)

**If ARPU = $80/mo:**
- Need: 129 paying customers
- At 40% conversion: Need 323 total users
- **Timeline: Month 2** (even faster)

---

## 💵 CASH FLOW (Critical for Bootstrap)

### **Worst case scenario (delay in revenue):**

| Month | Revenue | Costs | Cash Flow | Cumulative |
|-------|---------|-------|-----------|------------|
| 1 | $0 | ($10K) | ($10K) | ($10K) |
| 2 | $2K | ($11K) | ($9K) | ($19K) |
| 3 | $10K | ($12K) | ($2K) | ($21K) |
| 4 | $30K | ($15K) | $15K | ($6K) |
| 5 | $60K | ($20K) | $40K | $34K |
| 6+ | $100K+ | ($25K) | $75K+ | $109K+ |

**Maximum cash needed:** ~$25K (Months 1-3)

**Ways to reduce:**
- Self-code = no contractor cost (save $24K)
- Delay hiring until revenue = $10K MRR
- Use free tiers (DigitalOcean $200 credit, AWS $300 credit)

---

## 🚀 FUNDING OPTIONS (If Needed)

### **Option 1: Bootstrap (Recommended)**
- Use savings: $25K covers 3 months
- Revenue Month 4+: Self-sustaining
- Keep 100% equity

### **Option 2: Friends & Family**
- Raise: $50-100K
- Give: 5-10% equity
- Use for: Team + marketing
- Dilution: Minimal

### **Option 3: Angel/Seed Round**
- Raise: $250K-500K
- Give: 15-20% equity
- Use for: Team + faster growth
- Valuation: $1.5-2.5M pre-money

### **Option 4: Revenue-Based Financing**
- Borrow: $50-150K
- Repay: 10-15% of monthly revenue until 1.5X repaid
- No equity dilution
- Companies: Clearco, Lighter Capital

**Recommendation:** Bootstrap if possible (you don't need much cash)

---

## 💡 FINANCIAL WISDOM

### **The Rule: Revenue solves all problems**

**Bad path:**
- Raise $1M
- Spend 18 months building
- Hope customers appear
- Run out of money
- Fail

**Good path:**
- Bootstrap with $25K
- Launch in 6 weeks
- Get 10 paying customers
- Validate product-market fit
- Scale with revenue
- Raise from position of strength (if you want)

### **Your advantage:**
- High margins (90%+)
- Fast breakeven (Month 3)
- Low capital requirements ($25K)
- Scalable (software)
- Recurring revenue (sticky)

**This is a GREAT financial model.**
