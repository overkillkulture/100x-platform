# 🎯 AUTOMATION GAPS - OPPORTUNITIES TO FILL

## THE STRATEGY

**Commander's insight:**

> "We should make an opposing document that has automation that's missing to look for or that could be made like gaps we can fill"

**YES. Every gap = opportunity.**

**Every pain point = product.**

**Every manual task = automation to build.**

---

## HOW TO FIND GAPS

### METHOD 1: PAIN POINT TRACKING

**Every time you:**
- Get frustrated → Document it
- Waste time → Measure it
- Repeat task → Count repetitions
- Fight a UI → Screenshot it

**That's a gap.**

---

### METHOD 2: DESTROYER PATTERN ANALYSIS

**Look for:**
- Tasks that should take 30 seconds but take 45 minutes
- Settings hidden in 5 layers of menus
- Forms you fill repeatedly
- Logins you type daily
- **Any artificial complexity**

**That's a gap.**

---

### METHOD 3: COMPETITOR ANALYSIS

**What tools exist but suck?**
- Zapier (complex, expensive)
- IFTTT (limited)
- Microsoft Power Automate (overcomplicated)
- Traditional web builders (destroyer UIs)

**Build simpler versions.**

**That's multiple gaps.**

## GAP PRIORITIZATION FORMULA

```
Priority Score = (Frequency × Pain × Market Size) / Difficulty

Where:
- Frequency: How often task is done (daily=365, weekly=52, monthly=12)
- Pain: Time wasted in minutes
- Market Size: Number of potential customers
- Difficulty: Hours to build automation

Top score = Build first
```

**Examples:**

**DNS Configuration:**
- Frequency: 12/year (monthly for active businesses)
- Pain: 45 minutes
- Market: 1M+ businesses
- Difficulty: 20 hours
- Score: (12 × 45 × 1,000,000) / 20 = 27,000,000

**Form Auto-Filler:**
- Frequency: 365/year (daily)
- Pain: 5 minutes
- Market: 10M+ people
- Difficulty: 40 hours
- Score: (365 × 5 × 10,000,000) / 40 = 456,250,000

**High scores = high priority**

---

## GAPS WE'RE NOT FILLING (YET)
