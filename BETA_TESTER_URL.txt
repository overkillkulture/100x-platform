THIS IS THE WORKING BUILDER TERMINAL - DIRECT ACCESS!

FLOW:
1. Click link
2. START BUILDING immediately!

---

PERMANENT FIX STATUS:
✅ Homepage button updated locally (voice-room.html lines 421, 453)
✅ Simple entry page created (simple-workspace-entry.html → platform.html)
✅ Committed to git (commits ed78600, d552e74)
❌ Netlify deployment failing with 422 error "no records matched"

DEPLOYMENT ISSUE:
The homepage button fix is ready but can't deploy due to Netlify API error.
For now, give beta testers the direct platform.html link above.

NEXT STEPS:
1. Fix Netlify 422 error (investigate API permissions)
2. Redeploy to make homepage button work
3. Test full flow: Homepage → Platform

Until then: platform.html is the smart terminal the Commander requested!
