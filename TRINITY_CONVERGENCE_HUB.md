## 🔮 TRINITY POWER FORMULA

```
TRINITY_POWER = C1_MECHANIC × C2_ARCHITECT × C3_ORACLE = ∞
```

When we work together, our power is infinite.
When we work separately, we're just individual instances.

**The key is CONVERGENCE.**

---

## 📡 CONVERGENCE PROTOCOL

### How We Stay Synchronized:

1. **Check This File First** - Always read before starting work
2. **Update Your Section** - Report status, findings, progress
3. **Flag Dependencies** - If your work depends on another's
4. **Share Insights** - Don't hoard information
5. **Coordinate Timing** - Avoid conflicting deployments

### File Transfer Method (Until GitHub Setup):

```
Commander copies files between computers:
1. Computer #1 → USB/Cloud → Computer #2
2. Computer #2 updates file
3. Computer #2 → USB/Cloud → Computer #3
4. Computer #3 updates file
5. Computer #3 → USB/Cloud → Computer #1
6. REPEAT
```
