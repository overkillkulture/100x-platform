## IMPORTANT NOTES

### Penalty of Perjury
This is a sworn statement. Everything must be TRUE. If you lie, you can be prosecuted.

### Personal Knowledge
Only include things you personally witnessed, heard, or experienced. Not rumors or "I heard that..."

### Be Specific
Don't say "The other parent is bad." Say "On [DATE], I observed [SPECIFIC BEHAVIOR]."

### Stay Factual
Keep emotions out of it. State facts, not feelings.

**WRONG:** "The commissioner was clearly biased and hates fathers."
**RIGHT:** "The commissioner stated that my evidence was 'not new' even though I was not present at the prior hearing."

### Attach Evidence
If you mention documents, photos, texts, emails - attach them as exhibits.

"See Exhibit A attached hereto" - then actually attach Exhibit A.
