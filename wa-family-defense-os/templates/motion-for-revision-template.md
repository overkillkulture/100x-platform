### IV. LEGAL ARGUMENT

#### A. Standard of Review

Under RCW 2.24.050, any party may seek revision of a commissioner's order within ten days of entry. The reviewing judge examines the record before the commissioner and makes an independent determination. *See* RCW 2.24.050.

#### B. The Commissioner Erred by [CHOOSE YOUR ARGUMENTS]

**[ARGUMENT 1 - FAILURE TO CONSIDER EVIDENCE]**

RCW 26.09.191 requires the Court to consider evidence regarding child safety, including history of abuse, domestic violence, and other factors that pose a risk to the child. The Commissioner refused to consider evidence of [SPECIFIC SAFETY ISSUES], thereby failing to apply the mandatory requirements of RCW 26.09.191.

A court's refusal to consider relevant evidence required by statute constitutes an error of law. *In re Marriage of Kovacs*, [cite]. The Commissioner's failure to consider the evidence presented violates both statutory requirements and [Your Name]'s right to due process.

**[ARGUMENT 2 - MISAPPLICATION OF "NEW INFORMATION" STANDARD]**

The Commissioner stated that the evidence was "not new information" and therefore could not be considered. However, RCW 26.09.260 allows the court to consider "facts that have arisen since the prior decree or were unknown to the court at the time."

Because [Your Name] was not present at the [DATE] hearing, all information presented by [Your Name] was "unknown to the court" within the meaning of RCW 26.09.260. The Commissioner misapplied the statute by excluding this evidence.

**[ARGUMENT 3 - FAILURE TO MAKE REQUIRED FINDINGS]**

RCW 26.09.187 requires the Court to make findings regarding the best interests of the child, considering specific statutory factors. The Commissioner made no findings regarding [FACTORS IGNORED], and therefore the Order fails to comply with statutory requirements.

*In re Marriage of Littlefield*, [cite] requires specific findings on best interest factors. Conclusory statements are insufficient. The Commissioner's Order contains no analysis of the evidence presented and makes no specific findings on mandatory factors.

**[ARGUMENT 4 - DUE PROCESS VIOLATION]**

[Your Name] has a fundamental liberty interest in the care and custody of [his/her] child. *Troxel v. Granville*, 530 U.S. 57 (2000). The State may not restrict this fundamental right without due process of law.

Due process requires a meaningful opportunity to be heard. *Mathews v. Eldridge*, 424 U.S. 319 (1976). Where a court refuses to consider relevant evidence, the opportunity to be heard is meaningless, and due process is violated.

The Commissioner's refusal to consider the evidence presented by [Your Name] denied [him/her] due process under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 3 of the Washington State Constitution.

---

### V. CONCLUSION

For the foregoing reasons, [Your Name] respectfully requests that the Court grant this Motion for Revision, reverse the Commissioner's Order, and grant the relief requested above.

DATED this _____ day of _____________, 20___.
