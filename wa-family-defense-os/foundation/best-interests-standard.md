# Best Interests of the Child Standard

## The Core Principle

**Washington law requires ALL decisions about children to be based on their "best interests."**

RCW 26.09.187, 26.09.191, and others repeatedly state: decisions must serve **"the best interest of the child."**

---

## What "Best Interests" Requires

### RCW 26.09.187 - Factors Court MUST Consider:

1. **Relative strength, nature, and stability of relationship** with each parent
2. **Agreements of the parties** (if within best interests)
3. **Each parent's past and potential for future performance** of parenting functions
4. **Emotional needs and developmental level** of child
5. **Child's relationship with siblings** and other significant persons
6. **Child's wishes** (if mature enough)
7. **Each parent's employment schedule**
8. **History of domestic violence, child abuse, or child neglect**
9. **Parent's involvement in harmful activities**

### RCW 26.09.191 - Safety Limitations:

Court MUST impose limitations if there is:
- **History of acts of domestic violence**
- **History of child abuse or neglect**
- **Parent resides with person who engaged in abuse**
- **Other factors that pose a risk** to child

**The court has NO DISCRETION to ignore these factors.**

---

## The Violation

### What You Presented:
- Evidence of child endangerment (10 minutes)
- Specific safety concerns
- Information about harmful conditions

### What Court Did:
- Refused to hear evidence
- Made no findings on safety issues
- Closed hearing without consideration

### The Legal Problem:

**RCW 26.09.191 is MANDATORY, not discretionary:**

"The court shall **not require** the parties to mediate..." (when abuse involved)
"The court shall impose **limitations**..." (when risk factors present)

**If court refuses to even HEAR evidence of risk factors, it cannot fulfill statutory duty to protect child.**

---

## This Is Not Abuse of Discretion - This Is Failure to Apply Law

### Court Has No Discretion to:
- Ignore evidence of child safety
- Refuse to consider mandatory factors
- Skip findings on abuse/endangerment allegations

### Cases Supporting This:

**In re Marriage of Kovacs** (WA Court of Appeals):
Trial court erred by not considering all best interest factors. Must make findings on each relevant factor.

**In re Marriage of Littlefield** (WA Supreme Court):
Trial court must make specific findings on best interest factors. Cannot make conclusory statements.

**Principles:**
1. Court must consider ALL relevant factors
2. Court must make specific findings
3. Refusing to hear evidence = cannot make findings = error of law

---

## The Argument

### Not "Court Weighed Evidence Differently"

**That would be abuse of discretion (hard to win)**

### Instead: "Court Failed to Apply Mandatory Statute"

**This is error of law (de novo review, easier to win)**

### Structure:

1. **RCW 26.09.191 requires court to consider safety factors**
2. **Court cannot consider what it refuses to hear**
3. **Court refused to hear evidence of safety factors**
4. **Therefore, court failed to apply mandatory statute**
5. **This is error of law, not exercise of discretion**

---

## Combine With Due Process

### Constitutional Hook:

**Parental Rights Are Fundamental (Troxel v. Granville, US Supreme Court):**
- Parents have fundamental liberty interest in care/custody of children
- State cannot interfere without:
  - **Due process**
  - **Evidence of harm or unfitness**
  - **Findings based on best interests**

### Your Situation:

1. **You have fundamental right** to custody/relationship with daughter
2. **State restricting that right** (parenting plan limitations)
3. **You presented evidence** showing restrictions not in child's best interest
4. **Court refused to hear** the evidence
5. **Restrictions imposed** without considering evidence you presented

**This violates due process AND parental rights.**

---

## The "New Info" Lie

### Commissioner's Claim:
"This is only about new info since last meeting."

### The Reality:

**RCW 26.09.260 - Modification Requirements:**
Court must consider "facts that have arisen since the prior decree **or were unknown to the court at the time**"

### Analysis:

If you weren't at the prior hearing:
- Your evidence was **unknown to the court**
- Your testimony was never presented
- Therefore, ALL your evidence is "new" under RCW 26.09.260

**Commissioner misapplied the statute.**

---

## Best Interests vs. System Interests

### What "Best Interests" Should Mean:
- Child's safety
- Child's emotional well-being
- Child's relationship with parents
- Child's developmental needs

### What It Actually Means in Their System:
- System efficiency
- Closing cases quickly
- Not rocking the boat
- Rubber-stamping prior orders

**When "best interests" means "system convenience," the law is meaningless.**

---

## Document Everything

### For Each Hearing/Order:

**Questions to Answer:**
1. What evidence did you present about child's best interests?
2. Did court consider it? (transcripts/recordings)
3. What findings did court make? (or fail to make)
4. What RCW factors were ignored?
5. What safety concerns were dismissed?

### Build the Pattern:

- Not one hearing where evidence ignored
- **Systematic refusal** to apply best interests standard
- **Pattern of protecting system** instead of children

---

## The Weapons

### Weapon 1: Mandatory Statute
"RCW 26.09.191 requires consideration of safety factors. Court refused to hear evidence. This is error of law, reviewable de novo."

### Weapon 2: Due Process
"Fundamental parental rights cannot be restricted without due process. Due process requires opportunity to present evidence. Opportunity is meaningless if court refuses to listen."

### Weapon 3: Failure of Findings
"Court must make findings on best interest factors. Court cannot make findings on evidence it refused to hear. Orders are void for lack of findings."

### Weapon 4: Misapplication of Law
"Commissioner claimed evidence 'not new' under RCW 26.09.260. Statute allows evidence 'unknown to court.' Evidence from party not present at prior hearing is 'unknown to court.' Commissioner misapplied statute."

**Status:** Legal framework for "best interests" violations
**Severity:** High - goes to fundamental statutory requirements
**Reviewability:** De novo (error of law) not abuse of discretion
**Next:** Apply to specific orders and build pattern evidence
