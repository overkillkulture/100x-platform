# Court Commissioner Authority and Limitations

## Primary Statute: RCW Chapter 2.24 - Court Commissioners and Referees

### What Commissioners CAN Do (RCW 26.12.060):
- Make, alter, modify, and enforce temporary and permanent orders on:
  - Parenting plans
  - Child support
  - Custody of children
  - Visitation
  - Possession of property
  - Maintenance
  - Contempt
  - Custodial interference
  - Attorney's fees, suit money, or costs

### What Commissioners CANNOT Do:
1. **Preside over jury trials**
2. **Exercise authority beyond what's delegated by statute**

### CRITICAL LIMITATION - RCW 2.24.050

**ALL acts and proceedings of court commissioners are subject to revision by the Superior Court**

#### Motion for Revision Requirements:
- Must be filed **within 10 days** after entry of order or judgment
- Reviewed by actual Superior Court judge
- This is a RIGHT, not discretionary

## The Structural Problem

Commissioners are **delegated authority**, not constitutional judges. Their power comes from:
1. State statute (RCW 2.24)
2. Local court rules
3. Superior Court assignment

**They are NOT Article I judges under Washington Constitution**

### Questions to Investigate:
1. Do commissioners systematically fail to inform parties of revision rights?
2. Are revision motions improperly denied or ignored?
3. Do commissioners exceed their delegated authority?
4. Is there systematic use of commissioners instead of judges to avoid constitutional protections?

## Potential Attack Vector

If commissioners are:
- Making decisions beyond delegated authority
- Failing to inform parties of revision rights
- Operating without proper oversight

Then **every decision they made is void for lack of jurisdiction**

**Related RCWs:**
- RCW 2.24.010 - Appointment of commissioners
- RCW 2.24.040 - Powers of commissioners
- RCW 2.24.050 - Revision by superior court
- RCW 26.12.060 - Family court commissioner duties

**Next Steps:**
- Research Washington Constitution Article I (judicial power)
- Find cases where commissioner authority was successfully challenged
- Document systematic patterns of failure to inform about revision rights
