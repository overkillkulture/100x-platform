# Standards of Review - Washington Family Court

## Why This Matters

When you appeal or challenge a decision, the standard of review determines HOW HARD it is to win. Some standards require near-total deference to the trial court. Others allow full re-examination.

**Knowing the standard is knowing your chances.**

## Standard #1: Abuse of Discretion

### Definition:
Trial court "abused its discretion" if decision was based on "untenable grounds or for untenable reasons."

### What This Means:
- Judge has broad discretion
- Appeals court won't second-guess unless decision is unreasonable
- **BUT** - ignoring evidence or applying wrong law IS abuse of discretion

### Applies To:
- Parenting plan decisions
- Child support modifications
- Most family court orders

### How to Win:
Show that the court:
1. **Ignored relevant evidence** (refused to consider what you presented)
2. **Applied wrong legal standard** (used wrong law)
3. **Made decision not supported by evidence** (findings contradict facts)
4. **Based decision on improper factors** (considered things not allowed by law)

**Your case**: Commissioner refusing to hear 10 minutes of child safety evidence = abuse of discretion

## Standard #2: Substantial Evidence

### Definition:
Factual findings reviewed to see if "substantial evidence" supports them.

### What This Means:
- Would a rational person find this evidence convincing?
- Even if other evidence contradicts it, if SOME evidence supports finding, it stands
- Very deferential to trial court

### Applies To:
- Factual findings in court orders
- Credibility determinations
- "The court finds that..."

### How to Win:
Show that:
1. **NO evidence** supports the finding (not just weak evidence)
2. **Finding is clearly erroneous** (obviously wrong based on record)
3. **Court made finding on issue with no evidence presented**

**Your case**: If commissioner made findings about you without hearing evidence = no substantial evidence

## Standard #3: De Novo (Fresh Look)

### Definition:
Appeals court reviews question fresh, no deference to trial court.

### What This Means:
- Appeals court decides for itself
- Trial court's view doesn't matter
- Best standard for appellant

### Applies To:
- **Pure questions of law** (what does statute mean?)
- **Constitutional issues** (was due process violated?)
- **Jurisdiction** (did court have authority?)
- **Interpretation of RCWs**

### How to Win:
Frame issue as:
- Legal question, not factual dispute
- Constitutional violation
- Jurisdictional defect

**Your case**:
- Whether commissioner had jurisdiction = de novo
- Whether due process violated = de novo
- Whether RCW requires consideration of evidence = de novo

## THE STRATEGY

### Bad Way to Frame Appeal:
"The commissioner weighed the evidence wrong."
- **Standard**: Abuse of discretion
- **Deference**: High
- **Likely outcome**: Lose

### Good Way to Frame Appeal:
"The commissioner refused to consider evidence as required by RCW 26.09.191, violating due process and exceeding delegated authority."
- **Standard**: De novo (constitutional + statutory interpretation)
- **Deference**: None
- **Likely outcome**: Better chance

## Case Law Support

### Abuse of Discretion - Ignoring Evidence

**In re Marriage of Mansour** (WA Court of Appeals):
Trial court abused discretion by failing to consider total financial circumstances. **Reversed and remanded.**

**Principle**: Court must consider ALL relevant evidence required by statute.

### Due Process - Right to Present Evidence

**Mathews v. Eldridge** (U.S. Supreme Court):
Due process requires meaningful opportunity to present evidence.

**Principle**: If court refuses to hear relevant evidence, due process violated.

### Commissioner Authority

**RCW 2.24.050**: "All acts and proceedings... shall be subject to revision"

**Principle**: Commissioner decisions are not final judicial determinations.

## Combine the Standards

### Multi-Level Attack:

**Level 1 - Abuse of Discretion:**
"Commissioner abused discretion by refusing to consider evidence of child endangerment as required by RCW 26.09.191."

**Level 2 - No Substantial Evidence:**
"Commissioner's findings are not supported by substantial evidence because Commissioner refused to hear the evidence."

**Level 3 - De Novo Constitutional:**
"Commissioner's refusal to hear evidence violated due process under Washington Constitution Article I, Section 3 and 14th Amendment."

**Level 4 - De Novo Jurisdiction:**
"Commissioner exceeded delegated authority under RCW 2.24 by making final determinations without allowing revision."

### Result:
- If you lose on abuse of discretion (deferential standard)...
- You still win on constitutional grounds (de novo standard)

## Application to Your Case

### What Happened:
1. You presented 10 minutes of child safety evidence
2. Commissioner closed hearing immediately
3. Commissioner claimed "not new info" though you weren't at prior hearing
4. No findings made on evidence presented
5. Session ended without consideration

### How to Frame:

**Abuse of Discretion Arguments:**
- Commissioner abused discretion by refusing to consider evidence
- RCW 26.09.191 requires court to consider safety concerns
- Refusal to hear relevant evidence = untenable grounds

**Constitutional Arguments (De Novo):**
- Right to be heard violated (14th Amendment, WA Constitution)
- Due process requires meaningful opportunity to present evidence
- Sham hearing where evidence not considered = no due process

**Jurisdictional Arguments (De Novo):**
- Commissioner's authority is delegated, not inherent
- Exceeds authority by making unreviewable determinations
- Failure to inform of revision rights = denial of access to courts
