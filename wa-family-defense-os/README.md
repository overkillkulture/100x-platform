## The House of Cards

We're looking for the structural vulnerability - the one legal principle they violate so systematically that pulling it brings down everything built on top.

### Current Leads:
1. **Commissioner authority** - Delegated power without proper oversight
2. **ID verification** - Jurisdiction without proof of identity
3. **10-day revision window** - Systematic failure to inform parties of rights
4. **Due process** - Decisions without proper notice or opportunity to be heard
