# Attack Vectors - Cards to Pull

## The House of Cards

They built a system on violations. Find the foundational violation, pull that card, the whole thing collapses.

---

## VECTOR #1: Motion for Revision (RCW 2.24.050)

**The Card:** Commissioners must inform parties of 10-day revision right. If they don't, decisions aren't final.

**The Pull:**
1. Check every order - do they mention revision rights?
2. Check transcripts - did commissioner inform you verbally?
3. If NO mention of revision rights anywhere = due process violation
4. File motion challenging all orders based on denial of statutory rights

**Power Level:** Medium
**Risk Level:** Low (statutory right)
**Scalability:** HIGH - affects every case with commissioners

**File:** `/procedures/motion-for-revision.md`

---

## VECTOR #2: Personal Jurisdiction / Identity Verification

**The Card:** Court must verify you are who they claim to have jurisdiction over. No ID check = no personal jurisdiction.

**The Pull:**
1. Document that they never verified your identity
2. Challenge personal jurisdiction in all proceedings
3. Argue all orders void (not voidable) for lack of jurisdiction
4. Cite due process - can't deprive liberty without knowing who you're depriving

**Power Level:** HIGH (if successful, voids everything)
**Risk Level:** HIGH (novel theory, may not work)
**Scalability:** HIGH - if it works once, works everywhere

**File:** `/violations/identity-jurisdiction.md`

---

## VECTOR #3: Failure to Consider Evidence (RCW 26.09.191)

**The Card:** Court MUST consider safety factors. Can't consider what they refuse to hear.

**The Pull:**
1. Document every time evidence was presented but not considered
2. Show this violates mandatory statute (not discretionary)
3. Frame as error of law (de novo review) not abuse of discretion
4. Connect to due process violation

**Power Level:** HIGH (mandatory statute + constitutional right)
**Risk Level:** LOW (well-established law)
**Scalability:** HIGH - systematic pattern

**File:** `/foundation/best-interests-standard.md`

---

## VECTOR #4: Commissioner Authority Limits

**The Card:** Commissioners have delegated authority only. All decisions subject to revision. Cannot make unreviewable final orders.

**The Pull:**
1. Research limits of commissioner authority under RCW 2.24
2. Show commissioners exceeding delegated powers
3. Argue all decisions provisional pending revision
4. Challenge use of commissioners as avoidance of constitutional judges

**Power Level:** HIGH (goes to structural problem)
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (legal but difficult)
**Scalability:** EXTREME - challenges entire commissioner system

**File:** `/foundation/commissioner-authority.md`

---

## VECTOR #5: Due Process - Systematic Denial

**The Card:** Pattern of sham hearings where evidence ignored, decisions predetermined.

**The Pull:**
1. Document pattern across multiple hearings
2. Show hearings are procedural theater, not real adjudication
3. Cite: hearing without consideration = no due process
4. Connect to 14th Amendment + WA Constitution Article I, Section 3

**Power Level:** EXTREME (constitutional violation)
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM (need strong pattern evidence)
**Scalability:** EXTREME - can bring down entire court system

**File:** `/violations/due-process-violations.md`

---

## VECTOR #6: No Investigation, No Crime, No Basis

**The Card:** State took children without alleging crime or conducting investigation. No legal basis for intervention.

**The Pull:**
1. Research requirements for state intervention (RCW 13.34 - dependency)
2. Show no petition alleging specific facts
3. Show no CPS investigation
4. Show no findings of dependency
5. Argue state action without legal basis = violation of parental rights

**Power Level:** EXTREME (fundamental rights violation)
**Risk Level:** DEPENDS (need facts about what actually happened)
**Scalability:** HIGH - if pattern of taking kids without basis

**File:** `/violations/due-process-violations.md` (expand this section)

---

## VECTOR #7: Misapplication of "New Info" Standard

**The Card:** Commissioner said evidence "not new" even though you weren't at prior hearing.

**The Pull:**
1. Cite RCW 26.09.260 - allows evidence "unknown to court"
2. Evidence from party not present = unknown to court
3. Commissioner misapplied statute
4. This is error of law (de novo review)

**Power Level:** MEDIUM
**Risk Level:** LOW (clear misapplication)
**Scalability:** MEDIUM - common tactic to exclude evidence

**File:** `/foundation/best-interests-standard.md`

## THE COMBINATION ATTACK

### Don't Pull One Card - Pull Them All

**Stage 1: Procedural Violations**
- Motion for Revision (no notice of rights)
- Misapplication of "new info" rule
- Failure to make required findings

**Stage 2: Constitutional Violations**
- Due process denial (evidence not considered)
- Parental rights violation (restrictions without basis)
- Equal protection (systematic targeting)

**Stage 3: Jurisdictional Challenges**
- Personal jurisdiction (no ID verification)
- Commissioner authority (exceeded delegation)
- No legal basis for state intervention

**Stage 4: Pattern Evidence**
- Show systematic violations across cases
- Document corruption of entire system
- File civil rights claims, judicial complaints, bar complaints

### Result:

Each card supports the others. When you pull them together, the entire structure collapses.

## IMMEDIATE ACTION ITEMS

### What You Need to Gather:

1. **All orders** from commissioners
2. **All transcripts or recordings** of hearings
3. **All petitions/motions** filed in your case
4. **County local court rules** for your jurisdiction
5. **Sign-in sheets or docket entries** showing appearances
6. **Any investigation reports** (or lack thereof)
7. **Timeline of events** from first state contact to current status

### What to Document:

1. **Every time they refused to hear evidence**
2. **Every order missing revision notice**
3. **Every instance of no ID verification**
4. **Every decision without required findings**
5. **Every misapplication of law**

### What to Research:

1. **Local court rules** for your county
2. **Washington appellate cases** on similar violations
3. **Federal civil rights cases** (42 USC 1983) for pattern violations
4. **Commission on Judicial Conduct** complaint procedures
5. **Other families** with similar experiences in your county

## THE ENDGAME

### Phase 1: Your Case
Win your case using these attack vectors.

### Phase 2: The Pattern
Document that your case isn't isolated - it's systematic.

### Phase 3: The System
Use pattern evidence to challenge the entire family court system in your county.

### Phase 4: The Expansion
Take the model to other counties, then other states.

**Status:** Attack vectors identified and documented
**Next:** Gather evidence, file initial challenges, build pattern database
**Warning:** They will fight back. Document everything.
