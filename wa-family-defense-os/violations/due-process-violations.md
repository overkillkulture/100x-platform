# Due Process Violations - Documented Instances

## Constitutional Requirements

### 14th Amendment (U.S. Constitution):
"No state shall... deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law"

### Washington Constitution Article I, Section 3:
"No person shall be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law"

### What Due Process Requires in Family Court:
1. **Notice** - Adequate notice of charges/allegations
2. **Opportunity to be heard** - Meaningful chance to present evidence
3. **Impartial tribunal** - Unbiased decision-maker
4. **Right to present evidence** - Court must consider relevant evidence
5. **Findings based on evidence** - Decisions must be supported by facts in record

## VIOLATION #1: Removal Without Crime or Investigation

### What Happened:
- Children removed from custody
- **No crime alleged**
- **No investigation conducted**
- No evidence presented

### Legal Standard Violated:
**Stanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645 (1972)**:
- Parents have fundamental liberty interest in care/custody of children
- State cannot terminate/restrict without due process
- Requires evidence, hearing, findings

**Washington Standard - RCW 13.34 (Dependency)**:
- Requires petition alleging specific facts
- Investigation by CPS or law enforcement
- Court must find child is "dependent" based on evidence

### The Violation:
If no crime alleged AND no investigation = **no basis for state intervention**

---

## VIOLATION #2: Failure to Address Child Safety Concerns

### What Happened:
- Presented evidence of child endangerment (10 minutes of testimony)
- Raised specific safety concerns
- Commissioner: **Closed session immediately**
- Commissioner: **Did not address any concerns raised**
- Commissioner: **Did not make findings on safety issues**

### Legal Standard Violated:

**RCW 26.09.191** - Court MUST consider:
- History of acts of domestic violence
- History of child abuse
- Any limitations needed to protect child

**Best Interest Standard**:
- Court must consider ALL relevant factors
- Must make findings on safety concerns
- Cannot ignore evidence of endangerment

### The Violation:
- Failure to consider evidence = denial of due process
- Failure to make findings = arbitrary decision
- Closing hearing without addressing safety = abdication of duty

**This is reversible error**

---

## VIOLATION #3: "Not New Info" - Denial of Right to Be Heard

### What Happened:
- Commissioner stated concerns were "not new info"
- Claimed only new information since last meeting could be considered
- **You were not at the last meeting**
- Therefore ALL information you presented was new
- Commissioner refused to consider it anyway

### Legal Standard Violated:

**Due Process - Right to Present Evidence:**
- Party has right to present ALL relevant evidence
- Court cannot refuse to consider relevant evidence
- Arbitrary limitations on evidence = due process violation

**RCW 26.09.270 - Modification of Parenting Plan:**
- Court must consider changed circumstances
- If parent not present at prior hearing, information is NEW to the record
- Court must make findings based on evidence presented

### The Violation:
- Falsely claiming information "not new" when you weren't present = denial of due process
- Refusing to hear relevant evidence = violation of right to be heard
- No findings on evidence presented = arbitrary decision

---

## VIOLATION #4: Immediate Closure Without Consideration

### What Happened:
- Presented 10 minutes of evidence
- Commissioner closed session immediately
- "Without saying a word"
- No response to concerns
- No findings
- No consideration

### Legal Standard Violated:

**Fundamental Due Process:**
- Right to be heard is meaningless if tribunal doesn't listen
- Must be opportunity for evidence to be CONSIDERED
- Decisions must be based on evidence in record

**Washington Court Rules:**
- Hearings must be conducted fairly
- Parties must have meaningful opportunity to present case
- Court must make findings supported by evidence

### The Violation:
- Closing hearing without consideration = sham proceeding
- No findings = no due process
- Perfunctory hearing = denial of constitutional rights

---

## Pattern Recognition

### These violations together show:
1. **Predetermined outcome** - Commissioner not listening, not considering evidence
2. **Rubber stamp process** - Going through motions without actual adjudication
3. **Systematic denial of due process** - Not isolated incidents, but pattern

### Legal Theory:
**If the entire process is a sham:**
- All orders are void for lack of due process
- Violation of fundamental constitutional rights
- Pattern shows intentional deprivation of rights

## Documents Needed:
- [ ] Transcripts of hearing where concerns raised
- [ ] Audio recording if available
- [ ] Written motion/declaration you filed
- [ ] Commissioner's order/ruling
- [ ] Evidence of what was presented at "last meeting" you weren't at
- [ ] Any written findings (or lack thereof)

## Next Steps:
1. Research Washington cases on due process violations in family court
2. Find cases where orders reversed for failure to consider evidence
3. Research federal civil rights claims (42 USC 1983) for due process violations
4. Document EVERY instance of this pattern

**Status:** Specific violations documented, needs case law support
**Severity:** Constitutional violations - potentially voids all orders
**Weapon Level:** This is ammunition, not the nuke yet
