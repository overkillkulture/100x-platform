## IF YOU JUST GOT A COMMISSIONER'S ORDER (Last 10 Days)

### IMMEDIATE ACTION - DO THIS TODAY

1. **Check the date** the order was "entered" (not mailed, not signed - ENTERED)
2. **Count 10 days** from that date (or check your county's local rules - may be longer)
3. **If you're still within the deadline:**

   **GO TO:** `/templates/motion-for-revision-template.md`

   **DO THIS:**
   - Fill in the template with your facts
   - Fill in the declaration template (`/templates/declaration-template.md`)
   - File with court clerk TODAY
   - Serve copy on other party

4. **If you're past the deadline:**
   - Read `/procedures/motion-for-revision.md` for options
   - You may still challenge based on lack of notice
   - Continue to next section

## IF YOU'RE PREPARING FOR UPCOMING HEARING

### BEFORE THE HEARING

**Read These:**
1. `/foundation/best-interests-standard.md` - Know what they're required to consider
2. `/violations/due-process-violations.md` - Know your rights
3. `/procedures/motion-for-revision.md` - Know you have 10 days after any order

**Document Everything:**
- Bring someone to take notes
- Request recording if allowed
- Document everything you present as evidence
- Write down exactly what commissioner says

**What to Say:**

When presenting evidence: "This evidence relates to the best interests factors under RCW 26.09.187 and safety factors under RCW 26.09.191, which the Court is required to consider."

If they try to cut you off: "For the record, I am presenting evidence on mandatory statutory factors. The Court's refusal to hear this evidence will be preserved for appeal and for a Motion for Revision."

At end of hearing: "Does the Court's order include notice of my right to revision under RCW 2.24.050 and the ten-day deadline?"

## IF YOU'RE BUILDING A CASE AGAINST THE SYSTEM

### THE PROCESS

**Step 1: Gather Your Evidence**

**You Need:**
- All orders from commissioners
- All transcripts or recordings
- All petitions/motions you filed
- Timeline of events
- County local court rules
- Sign-in sheets or court records

**Step 2: Document the Violations**

**Use These:**
- `/violations/due-process-violations.md` - Document each violation
- `/violations/identity-jurisdiction.md` - Note if they never checked ID
- `/procedures/motion-for-revision.md` - Check if they informed you of rights

**Step 3: Identify Attack Vectors**

**Read:** `/ATTACK-VECTORS.md`

**Choose Your Weapons:**
- Motion for Revision (if within time)
- Constitutional challenges (due process)
- Jurisdictional challenges (commissioner authority, identity)
- Statutory violations (failure to apply mandatory law)

**Step 4: File Your Challenges**

**Start With:**
- Motion for Revision (lowest risk, established right)
- Motion to Vacate (if past revision deadline)
- Appeal (if final order)

**Build To:**
- Pattern evidence across multiple cases
- Civil rights claims (42 USC 1983)
- Judicial misconduct complaints
- Systemic reform litigation

## WHAT YOU'RE UP AGAINST

### They Have:
- Institutional power
- Experience
- Resources
- Presumption of regularity
- Each other's backs

### You Have:
- The truth
- The law (actual law, not what they do)
- Constitutional rights
- Pattern evidence
- This OS

### How to Win:

**Don't fight their fight.** They want you emotional, reactive, looking crazy.

**Fight with law.** Cold, factual, documented violations of specific statutes.

**Build the pattern.** One violation is "he said/she said." Ten violations is a pattern. A hundred violations is a corrupt system.

**Use their rules against them.** They created RCW 2.24.050. They have to follow it.

**Document everything.** Every hearing, every order, every violation. Build the record.

**Connect with others.** You're not alone. This is happening to lots of families.

## THE LONG GAME

### Your Case
Win your case or lose it - that's Step 1.

### The Pattern
Document that it's not just you - it's systemic.

### The System
Challenge the family court system itself.

### The Expansion
Take what works and spread it.

### The Change

## CRITICAL WARNINGS

### This OS Is Not:
- Legal advice from a lawyer
- A guarantee you'll win
- A substitute for actual legal representation
- Reviewed or approved by any bar association

### This OS Is:
- Legal research and documentation
- Templates based on actual statutes
- Strategic analysis of attack vectors
- Information other families can use

### You Are:
- Responsible for your own legal strategy
- Taking risks by challenging the system
- Potentially making them angry
- Fighting for your kid

**Choose accordingly.**

---

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Read** `/ATTACK-VECTORS.md` - Understand your options
2. **Gather** your evidence - All documents from your case
3. **Document** the violations - Use the templates in `/violations/`
4. **Choose** your strategy - Which attack vectors apply to you
5. **Execute** - File motions, build pattern, fight back

---

## SUPPORT

### This is a Solo Fight
There's no organization behind this. No lawyers. No funding. Just documentation and strategy.

### But You're Not Alone
Other families are fighting the same fight. Find them. Help each other.

### The OS Grows
As people use this and discover what works, document it. Add to it. Share it.

### The Goal
Not just winning your case. Changing the system so the next family doesn't need this OS.
