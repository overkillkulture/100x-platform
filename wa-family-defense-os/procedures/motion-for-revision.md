# Motion for Revision - RCW 2.24.050

## THE GUARANTEED APPEAL

**RCW 2.24.050**: "Any party in interest may have such revision upon demand made by written motion, filed with the clerk of the superior court, within ten days after the entry of any order or judgment of the court commissioner."

### Key Points:
- **NOT discretionary** - it's a guaranteed right
- **10-day deadline** (or local rules deadline, whichever is later)
- **Any party** can demand it
- **Real judge reviews** commissioner's decision
- **On the record** - based on what was before commissioner

---

## THE TRAP THEY SET

### What They Should Do:
- Inform parties of right to revision
- Clearly state 10-day deadline
- Provide notice of how to file

### What They Actually Do:
- Don't tell parties about this right
- Parties miss 10-day window
- Commissioner decisions become final by default
- System avoids judicial oversight

---

## THE VULNERABILITY

### Questions to Ask:

1. **Were you informed of your right to revision?**
   - Verbally at hearing?
   - In writing in the order?
   - In any notice?

2. **Did the order include notice of revision rights?**
   - Check every order from commissioner
   - Look for language about "right to revision"
   - Check if 10-day deadline mentioned

3. **What do local court rules require?**
   - Does county require commissioners to inform parties?
   - What's the local deadline (may be longer than 10 days)?
   - Are there specific forms required?

### If They Failed to Inform:

**This is a due process violation**

- Right means nothing if you don't know it exists
- Systemic failure to inform = denial of access to courts
- Creates unreviewable commissioner decisions
- Violates fundamental fairness

- Show systematic failure to inform parties
- File complaint with:
  - Court administration
  - Commission on Judicial Conduct
  - Bar Association
- Use as evidence of corrupt system

## TEMPLATE ARGUMENTS

### Argument 1: Due Process Violation
"RCW 2.24.050 provides a guaranteed right to revision. Respondent was never informed of this right, either verbally or in writing. The Court's order contains no notice of the right to revision or the 10-day deadline. This failure to inform denied Respondent access to judicial review and violates fundamental due process."

### Argument 2: Systematic Denial of Rights
"The Court systematically fails to inform parties of their revision rights, creating unreviewable commissioner decisions. This pattern shows intentional deprivation of statutory rights and demonstrates the family court operates as a closed system without meaningful judicial oversight."

### Argument 3: Commissioner Decisions Are Not Final
"All commissioner decisions are provisional under RCW 2.24.050. Where the Court has failed to provide notice of revision rights, the 10-day deadline cannot run, as it would violate due process to enforce a deadline for a right the party didn't know existed. The orders remain subject to revision."
