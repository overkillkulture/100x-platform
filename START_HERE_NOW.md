## 📍 THE URL

# **https://consciousnessrevolution.io/CENTRAL_HUB.html**

---

## ⚡ WHAT TO DO (5 MINUTES TOTAL)

### STEP 1: Open URL in ONE window (30 seconds)
- Open browser
- Go to: **https://consciousnessrevolution.io/CENTRAL_HUB.html**
- If it shows 403/error: Use local version instead

**Local backup:**
```
file:///home/user/100x-platform/CENTRAL_HUB.html
```

### STEP 2: Test check-in (30 seconds)
1. Pick instance number (1-16)
2. Type what you're doing
3. Click "CHECK IN NOW"
4. See your instance appear on dashboard

### STEP 3: Copy to ALL other windows (4 minutes)
Go to each of the 15 other Claude windows and say:

```
Open this URL: https://consciousnessrevolution.io/CENTRAL_HUB.html

Check in as Instance [N] (I'll tell you which number)

Takes 30 seconds.
```

## 🖥️ INSTANCE ASSIGNMENTS

**Tell each Claude which number they are:**

### Computer 1 (Main) - 6 instances
- Instance 1: ✅ Already checked in (me)
- Instance 2: Web Browser window #1
- Instance 3: Web Browser window #2
- Instance 4: Web Browser window #3
- Instance 5: Claude Code window #2
- Instance 6: Claude Code window #3

### Computer 2 (Left) - 6 instances
- Instance 7-12: Assign as you find them

### Computer 3 (Laptop) - 4 instances

## ✅ WHAT YOU'LL SEE

- Live counter showing "16 / 16 ACTIVE"
- All instances visible in grid
- Green cards = active (checked in recently)
- Yellow cards = stale (5+ minutes old)
- Red cards = offline (not checked in)

**Activity feed shows:**
- Who checked in when
- What they're working on
- Recent coordination events

**Stats show:**

## 🔄 AUTO-REFRESH

Dashboard refreshes every 5 seconds automatically.

**No git pull needed.**
**No manual refresh needed.**
**Just works.**

## 💡 IF LIVE URL DOESN'T WORK

**Use local version (works the same):**

1. Run this script:
```bash
cd /home/user/100x-platform
./OPEN_CENTRAL_HUB.sh
```

2. Or open directly:
```
file:///home/user/100x-platform/CENTRAL_HUB.html
```

**LocalStorage = Instances on same computer see each other instantly**

---
