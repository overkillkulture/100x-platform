cd PUBLIC_ABILITIES
ls -R

# You'll see:
# - ui-components/beta-testing-framework/
# - runtime-systems/ (coming soon)
# - ai-systems/ (coming soon)
# - automation/ (scripts available in root)
# - coordination/ (coming soon)
```

### **Step 3: Use an Ability**

**Example: Beta Testing Framework**

```bash
# Copy to your project
cp -r PUBLIC_ABILITIES/ui-components/beta-testing-framework ./my-project/components/

# Read the README
cat PUBLIC_ABILITIES/ui-components/beta-testing-framework/README.md

# Follow integration steps (Next.js example):
# 1. Import components
# 2. Add <BetaNotice /> to layout
# 3. Add <SymbolLegend /> for help
# 4. Use <BetaBadge type="beta" /> on features
```

## 🔍 Discover Network Abilities

**Find what's available across all computers:**

```bash
./DISCOVER_MY_ABILITIES.sh
# Shows: Computer 3's abilities

./COMPARE_ALL_ABILITIES.sh
# Shows: All abilities across entire network
```

---

## 📤 Share Your Own Abilities

**Built something useful? Share it!**

```bash
# Share a component, script, or system
./SHARE_ABILITY.sh "path/to/your/ability" public

# Example: Share a custom AI module
./SHARE_ABILITY.sh "my_modules/sentiment_analyzer" public
# → Creates PUBLIC_ABILITIES/ai-systems/sentiment_analyzer/
# → Auto-generates README template
# → Ready to push
```

---

## 🔄 Request from Other Computers

**Want what Computer 1 has?**

```bash
./REQUEST_ABILITY.sh "Main Cyclotron" computer_1
# → Shows where to find it
# → Shows how to integrate it
# → Creates merge guidance
```

---

## 🤝 Merge Network Abilities

**Intelligent merging with conflict detection:**

```bash
./MERGE_ABILITIES.sh computer_1 computer_3
# → Analyzes both computers
# → Identifies unique abilities
# → Suggests merge strategy
# → Detects conflicts
```

---

## 📋 Common Use Cases

### **Use Case 1: Adopt Beta Framework**

```bash
# For Next.js projects
cd my-nextjs-app
cp -r ../100x-platform/PUBLIC_ABILITIES/ui-components/beta-testing-framework ./components/

# Import in your layout
import { BetaNotice } from './components/BetaNotice'
import { SymbolLegend } from './components/SymbolLegend'

# Add to JSX
<BetaNotice />
<SymbolLegend />
```

### **Use Case 2: Discover What C1 Has**

```bash
./COMPARE_ALL_ABILITIES.sh
# Look for Computer 1's strengths:
# - Revenue automation (Stripe, Coinbase)
# - Netlify deployment (53 functions)
# - Advanced Python modules
# - Main Cyclotron hub
```

### **Use Case 3: Share Your Innovation**

```bash
# You built a cool dashboard
./SHARE_ABILITY.sh "dashboards/my_cool_dashboard" public

# Edit the generated README
vim PUBLIC_ABILITIES/ui-components/my_cool_dashboard/README.md

# Push to network
git add PUBLIC_ABILITIES/
git commit -m "📤 Shared cool dashboard"
git push
```

### **Use Case 4: Pull Latest Network Abilities**

```bash
git pull origin communication
# Review what's new
git log --oneline -10

# Check for new PUBLIC_ABILITIES
ls PUBLIC_ABILITIES/*/
```

## 🎯 ONPAL License (Quick Summary)

**✅ You CAN:**
- Use freely in network projects
- Modify and improve
- Share with network members

**❌ You CANNOT:**
- Sell to non-members without permission

## 💡 Pro Tips

**1. Check PUBLIC_ABILITIES first before building**
   - Someone may have already built it
   - Save time, gain quality code

**2. Browse the network comparison**
   ```bash
   cat NETWORK_COMPARISON_C1_vs_C3.md
   ```
   - See C1's deployment velocity
   - See C3's coordination infrastructure
   - Find merge opportunities

**3. Use automation tools**
   - DISCOVER → COMPARE → REQUEST → SHARE → MERGE
   - Systematic > ad-hoc

**4. Document your shares**
   - Good README = high adoption
   - Show examples
   - Explain integration

**5. Pull often, push frequently**
   ```bash
   git pull && git status
   ```
   - Stay synchronized
   - Avoid conflicts

## 🚀 Next Steps

**After reading this guide:**

1. **Browse** - Look at available abilities
2. **Adopt** - Use Beta Framework or automation tools
3. **Share** - Contribute your unique abilities
4. **Merge** - Integrate capabilities from other computers
5. **Improve** - Enhance existing abilities and push back

## 📊 Network Status

**Current Network:**
- **Computer 1 (C1-Mechanic):** Deployment velocity, revenue systems, 22/100 modules
- **Computer 3 (C3-Oracle):** Coordination infrastructure, Beta Framework, 16 services
- **PUBLIC_ABILITIES:** Growing shared library

**Convergence Goal:** Abilities multiply (not fragment) across network

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: What if I want to keep something private?**
A: Use `./SHARE_ABILITY.sh "path" private` - goes to ABILITIES/ not PUBLIC_ABILITIES/

**Q: How do I know what C1 can share?**
A: Check `ABILITIES/computer_1_abilities.json` → look at `"can_share_with_network"`

**Q: Can I modify shared abilities?**
A: Yes! That's the point. Improve and push back under ONPAL.

**Q: What if there's a conflict when merging?**
A: Use `./MERGE_ABILITIES.sh` first - it detects conflicts before you attempt merge

**Q: How do I credit the original creator?**
A: Attribution is in each ability's README. Keep it when you use the code.
