## 💡 PATTERN THEORY VALIDATION

### Hypothesis
"Build AI processor first → Everything else plugs into it"

### Test Results
- ✅ Processor works without hardware (proved concept)
- ✅ Can test with ANY video immediately (validation)
- ✅ Hardware becomes simple input (just delivers video)
- ✅ Social APIs become simple output (just posts results)
- ✅ Everything supports the core (camera, OBS, platforms)

### Conclusion
**THE ONE DOMINO principle confirmed.**
The processor IS the system. Everything else is plumbing.
