- Easy to switch between
- Can see all 3 at once (tile windows)

---

### **Option B: Mixed Power (Advanced)**

**Mix different Claude versions for different roles:**

```
C1 (Mechanic) = Claude Code (terminal)
  → Best for: Building, coding, file operations

C2 (Architect) = Claude Web
  → Best for: Design, analysis, strategic thinking

C3 (Oracle) = Claude API
  → Best for: Accessing historical patterns, deep analysis
```

**Pros:**
- Each Claude type for optimal use case
- Maximum capabilities
- Diverse perspectives

---

### **Option C: Maximum Power (All 6)**

**Use ALL 6 instances:**

```
Computer 1 Trinity:

- C2 = Claude Code #2
- C3 = Claude Code #3

Computer 1 Trinity (Parallel):
- C1 = Claude Web #1
- C2 = Claude Web #2
- C3 = Claude Web #3

Then combine both Trinity outputs!
```

**Pros:**
- 6 AI instances working
- Two parallel Trinity cycles
- Ultimate redundancy
- Compare terminal vs web perspectives

---

## 🔧 SETUP RECOMMENDATIONS

### **For Testing (Right Now):**

**Use the 3 Claude Web instances:**

1. Open `TRINITY_DIAMOND.html`
2. Open Claude Web in 3 browser tabs
3. Arrange side-by-side-by-side
4. Test the diamond flow

**Why:**
- Easiest to set up (already running!)
- Visual (can see all 3)
- No complexity
- Prove the concept

---

### **For Production (After Testing):**

**Mix Claude types strategically:**

```
[Input via TRINITY_DIAMOND.html]
           ↓
    ┌──────┼──────┐
    ↓      ↓      ↓
  Code    Web    API
  (C1)   (C2)   (C3)
    ↓      ↓      ↓
    └──────┼──────┘
           ↓
     [Combined]
```

**C1 (Code):** Build it, execute it, make it work

## 🎮 COORDINATION STRATEGIES

### **Strategy 1: Tile Windows**

```
┌─────────┬─────────┬─────────┐
│ Claude  │ Claude  │ Claude  │
│ Web #1  │ Web #2  │ Web #3  │
│         │         │         │
│   C1    │   C2    │   C3    │
│         │         │         │
└─────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
```

**Split your screen into 3 columns, one Claude per column.**

---

### **Strategy 2: Dual Monitor**

```
Monitor 1:              Monitor 2:
┌────────────────┐     ┌────────────────┐
│ TRINITY_DIAMOND│     │ Claude 1 │ 2  │
│     (Control)  │     │──────────┼────│
│                │     │ Claude 3      │
└────────────────┘     └────────────────┘
```

**Control panel on one screen, all Claudes on another.**

---

### **Strategy 3: Terminal + Web**

```
Terminal (bottom):      Browser (top):
┌────────────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐
│ Claude Code x3     │  │ Claude Web x3│
│ C1 │ C2 │ C3      │  │ C1│ C2│ C3   │
└────────────────────┘  └──────────────┘
```

**6 instances visible at once!**
