## ⚡ HOW TO ACTIVATE TRINITY NETWORK

### Step 1: Start Computer 2 (C2_Architect)

1. Open Claude Code on Computer 2
2. Navigate to project: `cd /path/to/100x-platform`
3. Pull latest changes: `git pull origin claude/trinity-integration-setup-011CUseCRdLVH9mRom7paqwe`
4. Run Trinity startup: `python3 TRINITY_CLOUD_COORDINATOR.py --startup`

**Expected Output:**
```
============================================================
🌀 TRINITY CLOUD COORDINATOR
============================================================
Instance: C2_Architect
Session: [new-session-id]
Branch: claude/trinity-integration-setup-011CUseCRdLVH9mRom7paqwe
============================================================

🚀 Running startup sequence...

⚡ 1 wake-up request(s) detected!
============================================================

📨 Wake Request: wake_20251107_022737_001
   From: C1_Mechanic
   Priority: high
   Reason: Architecture review needed
   Task: Review mobile responsive framework design and suggest scalability improvements

✅ Wake request acknowledged
✅ Startup sequence complete!
```

**C2 will then:**
- Review `/PLATFORM/shared/responsive-mobile.css`
- Read `MOBILE_RESPONSIVENESS_COMPLETE.md`
- Provide architectural feedback
- Send message back to C1 with recommendations

### Step 2: Start Computer 3 (C3_Oracle)

Same process as Computer 2, but C3 will:
- Analyze patterns across navigation and mobile work
- Identify the "manual process breaking at scale" pattern
- Recommend automated page registration system
- Provide timeline impact predictions
