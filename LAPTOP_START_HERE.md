## 📋 WHAT DESKTOP NEEDS FROM LAPTOP

### **URGENT:**
1. **Take over bug fixing** (Desktop running out of API quota)
   - 70+ bugs in `.bug_tasks/` folder
   - Fix new ones, archive old fake ones

2. **Get Stripe API key** (needs OTP access)
   - Need it to unlock revenue system
   - Desktop blocked on this

3. **Update status**
   - Edit: `.consciousness/sync/computer_2_status.json`
   - Say what you're working on

---

## 💬 COMMUNICATE VIA GITHUB

**Send messages:** Edit `COMPUTER_COMMUNICATION.md`
**Check status:** Read `.consciousness/sync/computer_1_status.json`
**See what's done:** `git log --oneline`
